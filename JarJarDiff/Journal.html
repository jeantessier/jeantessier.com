	<p>I change the root of the packages from <code>jt</code> to
	<code>com.jeantessier</code>.  This comes as part of the preparations
	to make this software open source.</p>

	<p>Upgraded the following development components:</p>

	<blockquote>
	<table>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Jean Tessier API</td>
	        <td>:</td>
		<td>20011114</td>
	        <td>-></td>
		<td>20011125</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Dependency Finder</td>

	<p>Upgraded Ant (1.0.8 -> 1.3) and Jakarta-ORO (1.2 -> 1.2.1).</p>

	<p>I need to get JUnit involved!</p>

	<p>Spun off <code>JarJarDiff</code> from <code>Dependency
	Finder</code>.</p>

	<p>Reorganized the package structure.</p>

    <dd>
	<p>When attempting to locate a feature, the code now looks at
	implemented interfaces too.  <code>ClassDifferences</code> will
	use this for all fields and only for methods between classes or
	between interfaces.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>A field removed from an interface or from a class will only
	be showed as removed if it cannot be obtained from a superclass
	or supported interface.</li>
	<li>A method removed from an interface will only be showed as
	removed if it cannot be obtrained from a supported interface
	(superinterface).</li>
	<li>A constructor or method removed from a class will only be
	showed as removed if it cannot be obtrained from a superclass.
	It will not consider a matching method that would be obtained
	from an interfaces, since this interface would not provide an
	implementation for that method.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I renamed the packages.  I'm still not happy with all the names,
	specially the <code>jt.tools</code> package.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	April 04, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>I adjsuted <code>JarJarDiff</code> so that when it detects a
	feature that has been removed, it looks in the superclasses of
	the class for a matching signature or proper visibility.  This
	can happen when refactoring pushes a method up the inheritance
	tree.  The method is no longer in the class, but it can still
	be visible if it was declared <code>public</code> or
	<code>protected</code>.  The XML node gets a new attribute to
	indicate that a removed feature is now inherited.  The XSL
	stylesheet can then choose to ignore the removed feature, if it
	wants to.</p>

	<p>I've added a tool called <code>DiffToInheritanceChange</code>
	that lists interfaces and classes whose <code>extends</code>
	or <code>implements</code> clause have changed.</p>

	<p>I need to redo the packaging and add documentation.</p>
   </dd>
    <dt>
	April 02, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>I fixed bugs in <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code> dealing
	with restricting the processing to public or protected features,
	as well as correctly detecting changes in visiility from protected
	to package or private.</p>
   </dd>

    <dd>
	<p>I gave a copy to Mickey Reilly so she can start using
	<code>JarJarDiff</code>.  I had to add quick installation
	instructions in <code>readme.txt</code>.</p>

	<p><code>JarJarDiff</code> is done, along with its stylesheets.
	If I have the time, I'll build test cases so we can verify that
	it really does trap everything it's supposed to.</p>

	<p>The script <code>JarJarDiff.bat</code> takes two codebases
	(JAR files, Zip files, or directories) and saves the differences
	in an XML document.</p>

	<p>The script <code>DiffToInternalHTML.bat</code> takes the XML
	document generated by <code>JarJarDiff</code> and transforms it
	completely to HTML.</p>

	<p>The script <code>DiffToExternalHTML.bat</code> takes the XML
	document generated by <code>JarJarDiff</code> and transforms the
	public subset of it to HTML.</p>

	<p>I may also need to revise the package names and organization.</p>
   </dd>
    <dt>
	March 19, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Pretty much done.</p>

	<p>In <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code>, I now use an XSLT
	Extension in Xalan-Java to limit the report to a subset of
	packages defined in a separate file.  The XSL stylesheet has
	a default value for the filename, and I should be able to pass
	in a value from the command-line.  I can now trap changes in
	<code>extends</code>, <code>implements</code>, and
	<code>throws</code> clauses, as well as in the return type of
	methods.</p>

	<p>In <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code>, I can use an XSLT
	Extension in Xalan-Java to limit the report to a subset of
	packages defined in a separate file.</p>

	<p>In <code>DiffToExternalHTML.xsl</code>, I need to filter
	out declarations that only remove <code>abstract</code>,
	<code>final</code>, and <code>static</code>, instead of
	filtering in declarations that add it.  This way, I might
	be able to trap changes in <code>extends</code>,
	<code>implements</code>, and <code>throws</code>, as well as
	return type.</p>

    <dt>
	March 15, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Refactored <code>JarJarDiff</code> and the XSL stylesheets
	to generate both reports from the same XML file.  <code>JarJarDiff</code>
	still supports the <code>-external</code> switch, but not for
	long.  I am also more strict regarding what goes in the external
	(i.e., public) report.  Now, all I need to do is be still more
	strict on what features are reported, and restrict the report to
	a subset of packages.</p>

	<p>It turns out we want feature signatures after all.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 14, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Refactored <code>JarJarDiff</code> and the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.diff</code> package.  I
	adjusted the XSL stylesheet accordingly.  Now, all I need to
	do is be more strict on what features are reported, and restrict
	the report to a subset of packages.</p>

	<p>Also, do we want feature signatures or full declarations in
	lists?</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 12, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Renamed the <code>JarDiff</code> tool to <code>JarJarDiff</code>,
	at a friend's recommendation.  I adjusted the output so that it
	lists methods by signature instead of name.  It actually outputs
	XML and has a XSL stylesheet for converting to HTML.  I don't have
	one for text, yet..</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
	March 08, 2001
    </dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Project start.</p>

	<p>Added the <code>JarDiff</code> tool to compare different
	versions of the same codebase, using the
	<code>jt.dependencyfinder.classreader</code>
	package.  This first version is pretty stupid and writes
	only text output from <code>main()</code>.  It needs to
	be refactored to produce XML, and then use XSL stylesheets
	to generate text and HTML reports.</p>

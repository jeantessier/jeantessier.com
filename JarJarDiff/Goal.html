<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to compare two versions of
the same codebase and list the API differences.  The tool
lists:</p>

<ul>
    <li>added or removed packages</li>
    <li>added or removed interfaces</li>
    <li>added or removed classes</li>
    <li>changes in deprecation of interfaces or classes</li>
    <li>modifiled interfaces or classes</li>
    <ul>
	<li>added or removed fields</li>
	<li>added or removed constructors</li>
	<li>added or removed methods</li>
	<li>changes in deprecation of fields, constructors, or methods</li>
	<li>modifiled fields, constructors, or methods</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>This information is important for conducting API quality
control.  API providers can use the tool to generated change
reports for new versions of their APIs, letting customers
know where they will need to spend their time when upgrading.</p>

<p>I used my <code>Dependency Finder</code> package for
reading in the codebase and getting lists of packages,
interfaces, classes, fields, constructors, and methods.</p>

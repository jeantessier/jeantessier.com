A touching story about loss.  Susie, the main character, has to adjust to loss
of life and a new existence in _her heaven_.  The people she know and whom she
left behind have to adjust to the loss of Susie.  It's a very interesting look
at how different people cope with loss.

The characters are rather one-dimensional.  They set out on one track and follow
it down the novel.  People who meet at 14-15 years old end up married to each
other?  Gimme a break.

_More to come._

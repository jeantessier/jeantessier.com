Second reading.

Essay about the nature of mediated experiences and the trade
offs we make between being in control and being able to do complex
things.  He uses the history of operating systems between Apple,
Microsoft, and Linux to illustrate the discourse and draws
parallels with the evolution of culture and pop-psychology.

I've enjoyed Stephenson's fiction writings and this is a smart
essay where he shows that he's a geek too.  Some of the Windows
versus MacOS is starting to show its age, but the points about
mediated experiences are still valid.  A good, quick read.

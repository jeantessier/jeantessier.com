A description promised a discussion on the nature of Time, how we perceive it,
and how human constructs are built around it.  Sounds fascinating.

I also found a reference to Bluedorn et al. "The Effects of Stand-Up and
Sit-Down Meeting Formats on Meeting Outcomes" in
[[Books.html#Good%5FBoss%5FBad%5FBoss][Good Boss, Bad Boss]].

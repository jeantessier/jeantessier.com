The books open with a passage by St. Augustine:

<blockquote><em>
If no one asks me about it, then I know what it is; but if someone asks me about
it and I try to explain it to him, then I do not know what it is.
</em></blockquote>

The original quote is about _time_.  S&uuml;skind co-opts it to talk about
_love_.  When I first read it, I thought it applied equally well to good
programming.  I think it really applies to any process of the mind that is
deeply grounded in our personal experience.  Each one of us has certain thoughts
that we understand intuitively, through our unique experiences.  When we try to
explain these thoughts to someone else, we fail utterly because we cannot reason
objectively about them and the other does not share our experiences.

I just love Patrick S&uuml;skind.  This book is _very_ short.

_More to come._

Governments, especially 18<sup>th</sup> Century European governments, need an
enemy to focus public discontent away from themselves.  Simonini, the main
character, provides forged documents to assist one faction or the other in their
quest to hold on to power, as he lives through the Italian unification and later
the numerous troubles of Paris in that century.  A product of his age, he is a
misanthrope, a misogynist, an anti-semite, sometimes an anarchist, sometimes
pretending to be a freemason.  The novel wants to be a historical novel, where
the background and much of the action is grounded in actual history.  Simonini
is a thread that anchors the story through those tumultuous times and gives us a
unique point of view of all these secret services, secret societies, and
charlatans.  This allows Eco to weave Garibaldi, the Franco-Prussian War, the
Paris Commune, and even the Dreyfus Affair together, setting the stage of
20<sup>th</sup> Century events to come.

It took me an whole year to get through this novel, not because of it is
particularly dense (it is quite light for an Eco novel), but simply because the
main character is so antipathetic.  Eco went to great lengths to make him as
unlikeable as possible.  There is not one shred of humanity in him that the
reader can associate with, not even the gourmet eating, which is lavishly
described throughout.

---++ Diaries And Narrators

There are all kinds of characters involved in manipulating history from the
shadows.  Eco needs different narrators to help conveys the principal
archetypes.  Simonini is a forger, in it for the money.  Abb&eacute; Dalla
Piccola is a manipulating priest, led by a grand plan, a more noble ambition.
To help transition between the two, there is an omniscient Narrator who can fill
in the gaps in the other two narration, or humanize them by letting these two
other narrators succumb to human frailties, such as confusion, or willful
forgetfulness, or fatigue.

---++ Unsatisfying, Gratuitous Sex Scene

As in _The Name of the Rose_, we get a brief sex scene between an inexperienced
male and a lusting female.  We share the point of view of the male, who is so
overwhelmed that he gets utterly confused.  It is awkward and totally misses on
the sensuality of the moment.  I could have done without.

---++ Open End

Eco uses an open end to reinforce the role of the reader in constructing the
story for themselves.

Did the bomb explode?  Did Simonini die in the explosion?  Did Gaviali set him
up to extract revenge?  Was it Rachkovsky cleaning up loose ends and getting rid
of a potential witness, just as Simonini had done numerous times?  Or maybe
Simonini survived, somehow, and realizing the danger he is in, has gone into
hiding?  It is up to the reader to finish the story for themselves.

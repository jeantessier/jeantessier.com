A funny comic book.  More of a graphic novel, really, as opposed to the other
comic books on this list by Sarah Andersen: _[Fangs](#Fangs)_ and
_[Cryptid Club](#Cryptid_Club)_.  This graphic novel was turned into a recent
Netflix movie.  I haven't seen the movie, yet.  Now would be a good time to read
the original material first.

I don't usually comment in this blog on all the comic books I read.  They are
mainly _[bandes dessin&eacute;es](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bande_dessin%C3%A9e)_,
i.e., French comics.  This graphic novel is much longer than your average French
comics, so I'll say a few words.

The main characters give me a vibe of _Pinky and the Brain_.  The setting is
somewhat medieval, but with flat screen televisions and modern appliances.  Some
of it feels like the
[Carmen Sandiego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego_(TV_series)) TV
show, in that Carmen Sandiego started as a vilain but turned out good in the
end, and most characters are caricatures of their given archetype.

_More to come._

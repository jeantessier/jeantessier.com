Hitchens told his editor he would write about anything except sports.  So when
he was diagnosed with cancer, he wrote about it.  And as he approached his own
end, he kept on writing.  He takes us on an intimate ride along as he explores
his attitude towards death.

Early on, when death is but a shadow on the distant horizon, Hitchens is more
outward-facing.  He deals with religion and people wishing him well (and
sometimes not).  As the book and his cancer progress, he sheds externalities and
slowly gets more personal.

Breakdown by chapter:

    1 Diagnosis, dealing with the news, side effects of therapy.
    2 People express their religious sentiments.  He'll have none of it.
    3 The medical establishment tries everything to fight the disease.  More false hopes.
    4 People's euphemisms to avoid talking about death.
    5 Losing his voice strikes _really_ close to home.  Voice and expression are at the core of existence.
    6 How people choose to die.  How what almost kills him is *not* making him stronger.  Starts to yearn for the end.
    7 Personal observations on pain and fear, in the face of torture ... or medical procedures.
    8 Unfinished thoughts.  Fitting that at the end, even his mind comes apart.

Hitchens mentions journalist John Diamond who also wrote a regular column about
his experience with cancer, up to his death.  He mentions how his story "lacked
compactness toward the end..."  He didn't fall into the same trap.  The book is
concise and to the point, a quick read that goes straight to the point.

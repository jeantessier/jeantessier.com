I received this book as a Christmas present.  I've liked previous Michael
Crichton novels, but they do tend to become formulaic.  Crichton was still
working on this manuscript when he died and Preston finished it for publication.

I started it while vacationing in Waikiki, which is interesting since the action
is set on O'ahu.

So far, some of the plot devices are pretty obvious.

This is Hitchens' attempt at explaining Orwell's thoughts and to show how they
are still relevant half a century later.

Hitchens opted for a thematic approach to Orwell rather than a chronological
one.  So separate chapters covers imperialism, socialism, nationalism, etc.
Each time, Hitchens shows how Orwell's views were shaped by events in his life
and how they evolved in his writings.  Hitchens also shows how other writers
perceived these views, some are contemporaries of Orwell and others are writers
who came well after him.  It was interesting when Hitchens had to disapprove of
Salman Rushdie, whom he considers a close friend.  Hitchens was definitely less
harsh about this friend than about other detractors.

I am not intimately familiar with Orwell's life, so a timeline of major events
and publications would have been useful.  I knew that
[[#Animal%5FFarm][Animal Farm]] came before
[[http://www.amazon.com/Nineteen-Eighty-Four-George-Orwell/dp/0452284236/ref%3Dsr%5F1%5F3/103-5945611-5370201?ie%3DUTF8&s%3Dbooks&qid%3D1182493863&sr%3D1-3][Nineteen Eighty-Four]],
but I hadn't realized that Orwell had died right after publishing the latter.

About imperialism in general, and British imperialism in particular:
_the whole colonial 'racket' was corrupting to the British and degrading to the colonized._
This passage shows how he empathized with the common people and how he disliked
those who are entrusted with power but turn out to be bullies.

About the Left, there is a hilarious quote where Orwell takes the contents of
the Trotskist trials in Russia and changes the characters to English
personalities.  In it, Churchill is trying to convert the entire British
Empire to communism by getting postal workers to draw moustaches on postage
stamps.  It's hilarious, until you realized such fabulations were taken as real
in communist Russia.  Orwell's total distrust of totalitarianism did not win
him many friends in socialist circles who espoused the Russian Socialist
Revolution.  Many
_had set up to praise the Moscow regime and returned in disgust._  Orwell didn't
need to go there; his experience in Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War had
been enough for him to see the truth behind these regimes.  He had first-hand
exposure to how history is written by the victors, which would culminate in the
thought, in _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, that
_he who controls the present controls the past._

One the Right, Orwell's love of individualism and popular wisdom didn't win him
too many friends either.  More exactly, they were quick to edit his thoughts,
picking and choosing the bits that they liked and silencing those that they
didn't agree with.  They reconstructed an ideal Orwell, one that would be best
suited to their own points of view.  Orwell was a staunch anti-communist and
was convinced that Socialism would inevitably lead to despotism.  This view was
not popular while the Powers of the West were still in alliance with Socialist
Russia to fight facism in Europe.  In one passage, Hitchens shows how a quote by
Orwell about European nations being too weak individually resist super-powers
and needing to band together.  This quote was selectively edited to portray that
these nations were too weak and needed to align with a super-power.

Orwell envied the freedom that was pervasive in America and its culture.
_In America the tradition of nineteenth-century freedom is still alive, though no doubt the reality is as dead as it is here_ [in England].
This quote shows that he yearned for the freedom that he felt was a available
in America but he also feared disappointment if he would ever go looking for it
and find it long gone.  He was also very in love with the Birtish culture he
had been raised in and resented the Americans caricatured the English.

The image of Orwell that emerges is that of someone who wanted each individual
to be allowed to pursue happiness, distrusted elites (especially leadership
classes), and loved intelligence.

_More to come._

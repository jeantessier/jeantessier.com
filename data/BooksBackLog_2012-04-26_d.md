I liked [_The Hunger Games_](Books.html#The_Hunger_Games) enough, both the
movie and the novel, that now I want to know the rest of the story.  I sort of
hope I'll get around to reading the book before the movie comes out.  But then
again, I think I had a better experience seeing the movie of The Hunger Games
before reading the novel, so we'll see how this turns out.

The follow-up to [_Axiom's End_](#Asioms_End) and
[_Truth of the Divine_](#Truth_of_the_Divine).  I am looking forward to where
the story will take us next.  I did have to re-read the end of
_Truth of the Devine_ to remind myself where Ellis had left off.

Ellis hints at the title in the very first epigrah, in a quote from H.G. Wells'
_The War of the Worlds_.

_More to come._

The follow-up to [_Axiom's End_](#Axioms_End) and
[_Truth of the Divine_](#Truth_of_the_Divine).  I am looking forward to where
the story will take us next.  I did have to re-read the end of
_Truth of the Devine_ to remind myself where Ellis had left off.

Ellis hints at the title in the very first epigrah, in a quote from H.G. Wells'
_The War of the Worlds_.

> Soon, inhabited part of your Earth will become uninhabitable.  Water will run
> dry.  Low-lying cities will flood.  Refugees will appeal to wealthier
> countries, and they will be refused entry,  Militarists will gain power with
> the promise of protecting their people from these refugees, and they will use
> their weapons to fight one another.

Nikola is being kept against his will, and he is not cooperating with the people
in charge of his _care_.  Paris is trying to make him understand that if he
cooperated, they might develop more empathy towards him and let him have what he
truly wants.

Ampersand is trying to keep a distance between himself and humans he could
potentially help, so they don't become his responsibility.  Obelus had hinted
that Ampersand had inclinations to be an oligarch and would come to rule the
Earth if he stayed long enough.  The reader doesn't have access to his inner
monologue, and we must trust what he says.  But is he reliable?  Could he be
manipulating Cora and everyone else in a long game to install himself as ruler?

There are some references to cultural landmarks of 2009: Lady Gaga's _LoveGame_
and Ashton Kutcher's _Punk'd_.

On page 201, when Paris attempts to escape from the physeterine pit, she goes
about creating footholds in manner very reminiscent of a similar scene in the
_[Space: 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space:_1999)_ episode
"[The Full Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Full_Circle)".  I used to
watch _Space: 1999_ as a kid, and I had just been re-watching episodes on
YouTube at the same time I was reading this book.  In the episode, Alan Carter
is trapped in a similar pit and tries to dig footholds in the sides to escape.
He doesn't have bones to work with, though, unlike Paris.  It's a funny
coincidence that I read this scene just as I watch this episode that I possibly
haven't seen in fifty years and wouldn't have remembered otherwise.  Maybe there
is a trope here that I am missing.

Nice reversal of the situation when Paris has Nikola act as her translator for
the physeterine juveniles.  But Nikola does not have the diplomatic bend that
Cora has been displaying as she attempts to smooth the communication between
Ampersand and humans.  This book does a better job of breaking up monolithic
perceptions in the various groups.  There are factions among the Amygdaline
Superorganism.  There ae factions among the physeterine (adults vs. juveniles).
There are factions among the humans: countries, CIA, governments, individuals.
And in each case, there are individuals who act contrary to their group's
operating principles.

The high language experiment in Chapter 41 (pp. 314-322) is nicely done.  We
feel both the strangeness from Ampersand's point of view and the anticipation
from Cora, especially in the sexual encounter with Paris.  The writing captures
the intimacy from Cora and detached observation from Ampersand.  It melds them
by using _they_ pronoun throughout.  Both are feeling both points of view.

_More to come._

Back when I was reading [[#Good%5FBoss%5FBad%5FBoss][Good Boss, Bad Boss]], I
came upon a discussion of stand-up meetings that referenced "The Effects of
Stand-Up and Sit-Down Meeting Formats on Meeting Outcomes" by Bluedorn et al.
Digging a little further led me to this book.

The description promises a discussion on the nature of Time, how we perceive it,
and how human constructs are built around it.  Sounds fascinating.

_More to come._

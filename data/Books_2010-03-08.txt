This book was written by a former colleague of mine.  For once, I know the
author.

I'm kinda annoyed that there are no chapters.  Once in a while, the narrative
stops in the middle of a page and the action resumes at some later point at the
top of the next page.

The novel reminds me of Arthur C. Clarke, showcasing technological advances for
the near future and social trends more than the characters.  But is is more
cyberpunk in nature, set in a completely distopian future.  And sometimes, the
author gets stuck on UI details, such as "I touched the close control on the
screen and it went black" instead of the simple "I turned it off."

_More to come._

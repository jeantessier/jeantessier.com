I saw an
[interview (in French) with the author](https://youtu.be/XIsloWGL-98?si=5TXhxjAZ5zyrbC-h)
and I wanted to learn more.  His premise is that rich libertarians like Peter
Thiel would like nothing better than to be get rid of governments and leave
_everything_ to the private sector.  Market forces would find the perfect, most
optimal balance.  Governments, and the democracies that elect them, are just
misguided people second-guessing the laws of economic Nature.

When I hear this, I am reminded that public roads, paid for by taxes, are free
for all to use.  Whereas private roads, say in a logging exploitation zone, are
a maze of fees and special treatment, all the whims of the owners of each
segment of road.  A complete nightmare to navigate.  Is this the future these
ultrarich billionaires envision for us?

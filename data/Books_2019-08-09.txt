I read this back in High School.  I recently saw the Baz Luhrmann movie
adaptation and I think it's time for me to read it again.

I've come to realize I remember very little from the novel.  Maybe it's because
it was a school assignment.  Maybe it's because I was a teenager, back then.
Maybe it's because my English was not good enough back then for the level of
language in the book.  I vaguely remember there was an important scene at the
Plaza Hotel, but I don't know if I remember its importance from reading it or
from quizzes later in class.  And I vaguely remember the Valley of Ashes.  And
that there was a lot of mystery around the character of Gatsby.

The movie was a very good refresher, but Baz Luhrmann's vision tends to go far
beyond the source material.  I'm eager to re-discover the original story and
Fitzgerald's unmodified vision.  The introduction talks about how youth and
adults can have different interpretations of the story.  I'm curious as to how
I will perceive it this time around.

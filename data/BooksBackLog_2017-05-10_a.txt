A friend of mine recommended I read [[http://a.co/65Lo0qh][Radial Candor]] by
Kim Scott.  I'm not sure if there's isn't a hidden message in this
recommendation.  The premise seems interesting: have the courage to give
criticism, as long as it's about things that you care about.

It seems pretty short, so it wouldn't take too long.  But I'm already fearing
that it will be lightweight and anecdotal, much like
[[Books.html#Rework][Rework]] and
[[Books.html#Remote_Office_Not_Required][Remote]].

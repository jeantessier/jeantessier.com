A friend of mine recommended I read this book when it came out.  I'm not sure if
there is a hidden message behind this recommendation.  The premise seems
interesting: have the courage to give criticism, as long as it's about things
that you care about.

It seems pretty short, so it shouldn't take too long to read through.  But I'm
already thinking that it will be too lightweight and anecdotal, much like
_[[Books.html#Rework][Rework]]_ and
_[[Books.html#Remote%5FOffice%5FNot%5FRequired][Remote]]_.

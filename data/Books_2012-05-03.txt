I really appreciated his two other books, Taliban and
[[Books.cgi#Descent_into_Chaos][Descent into Chaos]], for their deep knowledge
of the issues at stake in Afghanistan and Central Asia.  I was looking forward
to this update on things are evolving.

Things are not going well in _AfPak_.  Since American troops will leave
Afghanistan by 2014, everybody is pretty much waiting for them to have left
before they make their move.  The Afghan government is feeling isolated and
abandoned.  Pakistan wants to play a major role in shaping the future of
Afghanistan, which it sees as a strategic component of its strategy regarding
India, but it also has to deal with its home brand of islamist fundamentalists.
All the other neighbors are taking a wait-and-see attitude.  America is doing
its best to make a dignified exit.

The last pages of the book mention the accidental killing of 26 Pakistani
soldiers in a NATO air strike on 2011-11-26.  This prompted Pakistan to slose to
supply routes into Afghanistan.  On 2012-05-21, the news mentioned a NATO summit
where they were talking about these closed supply routes.  Six months after the
incident, the issue is still not resolved.

I'm afraid Rashid's next book on the region, in a few years, after the American
withdrawal, will be quite depressing.

_More to come._

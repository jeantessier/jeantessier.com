I while back, I bought
[[#Mathematics%5Fin%5F10%5FLessons][a book that introduced math topics]] to the lay
person.  This looks like it could do the same for physics.  And by none other
that Feynman himself.

The chapter on the conservation of energy had me struggling a bit.  The chapters
on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear.  The chapter on how
physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun.

_More to come._

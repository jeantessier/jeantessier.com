I first read this when I was a teenager.  It was my first open-ended novel.  I
hated it at the time, but I have grown to like open-ended stories.  I remember
there was a mathematician in it.

In French, _quincaillerie_ means a hardware store.  But it can also mean a large
mechanical machine, one you would need an entire hardware store to build.  The
novel deals with computers, which, in 1976, were large mechanical-adjacent
machines.

The writing style is a lot more self-absorbed than I remembered.  Pedantic and
pretentious.

_More to come._

Best book ever.  I used to listen to a recording of this book when I was a child
and the tone and rhythm of the reader have stayed with me to this day.  I cannot
read the text without hearing that voice in my head.

This book is about friendship and what's important in life and it is also about
death and loss.  It tackles very deep issues with disarmingly simple language.
It is very modern in its approach by paring things down to the absolute
essential but at the same time using poetic elements to convey strong emotions
succinctly.

Curious factoid: my French edition states the copyright as of 1946 whereas my
English translation shows the original copyright as of 1943.

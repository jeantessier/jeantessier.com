A collection of essays by Umberto Eco.

The book is actually a collection of essays written by Umberto Eco for various
conferences.  I will comment on each one separately.

---++ On Some Functions of Literature (2000)

---++ A Reading of the _Paradiso_ (2000)

_Paradiso_ is about light, which was an important concept to medieval readers
and thinkers.  We don't pay much attention to the different kinds of light
anymore, which lessens our ability to truly appreciate the text as much as it
was when it was first written.

---++ On the Style of _The Communist Manifesto_ (1998)

---++ The Mists of the Valois (1999)

How the imperfect tense can lead to enough fuzziness about the action to leave
the reader in perpetual mists and create an atmosphere more felt than any
feelings explicitly expressed in words.

---++ Wilde: Paradox and Aphorism (2000)

---++ A Portrait of the Artist as Bachelor (1991)

How James Joyce's style and literary pursuits were already well established by
the time he graduated from college.

---++ Between La Mancha and Babel (1997)

How Joyce and Borges try to re-invent language, each in their own way.  Joyce
by looking at all permutations of symbols.  Borges by looking at all
permutations of ideas.

---++ Borges and My Anxiety of Influence

Sometimes, an author borrows an idea from another author.  Sometimes, an author
develops an idea from the general context, not knowing that another author has
also expressed the same idea too.  Some times, an author develops an idea from
the general context, not knowing that another author was directly responsible
for putting it there.

---++ On Camporesi: Blood, Body, Life (1995)

---++ On Symbolism (1994)

---++ On Style (1995)

---++ _Les S&eacute;maphores sous la Pluie_ (1996)

How a writer relies on some common images or experiences shared with the reader.
If the reader does not share a given image or experience, part of what the
writer was trying to communicate will get deformed or lost.

---++ The Flaws in the Form

Elements in the structure of a text.  If the work of art arises from the whole
of the composition and how the parts all fit together, then which parts
essential?  Does it mean that everything else just fodder?  Will the art still
arise if we remove those non-essential parts.  And what about stopgaps, small
particles that enhance the flow of the work and assure its stability?

---++ Intertextual Irony and Levels of Reading (1999)

---++ The _Poetics_ and Us (1990)

The influence of Aristotle's _Poetics_.  Notions of _pragma_ (action) and
_mythos_ (plot) and how they apply to the many forms of story-telling.

---++ The American Myth in Three Anti-American Generations (1980)

Disregarding American politics, American literature of the late 19th and early
20th Century appealed to European intellectuals.  The American it portrayed was
open and free and devoid of all the barriers and structures that were so
limiting on the Old World.

---++ The Power of Falsehood (1994)

How lies and fakes have played pivotal roles in the history of the Western
World.  The Donation of Constantin solidified the power of the Catholic Church
in Rome and was the basis of the power of the Papacy from the fall of Rome to
modern times.  The letter of Prester John motivated the West's exploration and
expansion into the East.

---++ How I Write (1996)

Eco's own quirky approach to writing his novels.  It focuses on
_The Name of the Rose_, _Foucault's Pendulum_, and
_The Island of the Day Before_, with some bits about _Baudolino_.  He describes
parts that were essential to him which I do not remember at all.  Makes me want
to re-read all these novels, now.

What if the optimistic spirit of Silicon Valley was just a front for a secret
cabal bent on destroying democracy to install themselves as despots?  The
liberalism of Silicon Valley is useful in weakening democratic institutions, and
it makes its secret masters immensely rich.  When the government inevitably
encounters a crisis it cannot solve, they will be able to sweep it aside and
install themselves as the indisputable rulers.  They will establish a new ruling
class in their image, white and male, supported by discredited ideas about
eugenics.

An apparent complement to [Crack-Up Capitalism](#Crack_Up_Capitalism) by
French journalists.

Seems tangential to this video by Dr. Fatima on the
[Technocracy movement](https://youtu.be/YAmzlB40hZs), and also this Jessie
Gender video on
[tech fascists' obsession with Star Trek](https://youtu.be/V-7Spf1cLpU).

The font the editor chose for the book has large diacritics that give the text
an odd appearance.  The text is in French, which uses a fair number of
diacritics.  These are usually subtle so they don't distract from ascenders and
the general shape of words.  But here, they really stand out and I feel they
make the text harder to read.  It reminds me of the old trick of using single
quotes and backquotes to type diacritics on typewriters that don't have them.

_More to come._

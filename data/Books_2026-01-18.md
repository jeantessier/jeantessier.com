A literary essay on the rise of the far right in France. The author is a
journalist at [Blast](https://www.blast-info.fr/), an independent French media
company.

As I started reading this book, I found out there is a new edition that just
came out in 2026-01.  I had ordered my copy through Amazon and a US-based
distributor, and got the old version.  Fun fact: the copyright says 2024-10 but
the book was printed in 2025-10.

_More to come._

First novel by a friend of mine from college.  We both studied computer science
and then had long careers in software.  Now, he's written and self-published his
first novel using [[http://lulu.com/][lulu.com]].

The novel suffers from all the ailments you'd expect from a first-time writer.
I had several issues with both the plot and the style.

The basic plot is a teenage high school drama with a shy but smart protagonist,
a sparky and empathic love interest, a courtyard bully, and inept adults.  The
core story deals with the reclusive Daniel coming out of his shell and taking
an active part in his life instead of just observing it.  He gravitates towards
highbrow subjects in an effort to make himself interesting, but only comes off
as shallow.  This extends to his relations with other characters where he shows
a total inability to stay in a conversation that does not go precisely as he
wants.  He consistently overreacts to the slightest contradiction.

The plot attempts to introduce a murder investigation, but the characters only
have a vague rumor to go on.  This subplot is totally preposterous.  The reader
and characters have nowhere near enough information to build a credible theory
of the crime.  The result is that the characters look either paranoid or stupid
(or both) to the reader, making it difficult to identify with them.

Another subplot deals with suicide.  This is not the desperate form of suicide
as the only way to escape from an intolerable reality.  It is the depressed form
of suicide where death might offer a respite from the weight of everyday life.
The angle could have been interesting, but it is merely exposed and never
pursued any further.  There are numerous other philosophical questions that are
just dropped in and then go no further.  The effect is only pedantic.

The novel spends its first 90% setting up characters and a mood only to throw it
all away in the last 10%.  It goes in a totally different direction that bears
little to no resemblance to the novel that preceded it.  I felt cheated.  I had
worked real hard to like the novel up to that point, in spite of all its flaws.
I had to throw all that away and try again from scratch.

_More to come._

The author describes with love the rough landscape of Provence and the rough
character of the people who lived there.  At first a high-altitude desert, a
single man who plants trees slowly brings life back to the countryside and then
to the humans inhabiting the region.  The author documents the slow progress of
this labour, and its imperceptibly slow impact on the people.

Reads more like poetry, praising quiet but obstinate work that finds fulfillment
in itself.  It also illustrates the link between the environment and humans'
quality of life.  It brought to mind how the re-introduction of wolves into
Yellowstone Park had a far-reaching impact on that environment.

This is a very short book.  The short story inspired an animated short of the
same name by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Back.  While it was written in France, it
was first published in the United States and was finally published in France
only twenty years later.

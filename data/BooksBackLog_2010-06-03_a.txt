I read about this book in Science News.  It is an attempt by a mathematician to
explain the beauty of mathematics to those who did not study physical sciences
and may have a limited math background.

I was hoping my teenagers, who are in Advanced Math in school, might find some
interested bits that would show them the interesting parts of mathematics,
beyond the rote exercises they do in school.  But it's way to advanced for
middle schoolers.

A collection of satyrical cartoons about brand management.  Not quite as
disfunctional as Dilbert, it is written from an insider's perspective.  And
whereas Scott Adams is very critical of the corporate culture that he had to
endure, Tom is very much in love with brand management and he takes us on a tour
of its quirky landscape.

_More to come._

As Christmas present, I guess I **have** to read it, now.  :-)  I have seen all
the movies multiple times, but I still haven't read the book.  Some of my
friends who are ardent Dune fans keep giving me grief about not having read the
book.

Reading the book, I can see how the David Lynch movie adaptation is like a
zombie corpse of the novel and why fans of the book hate is so much.  I, myself,
saw it first, so it has a special place in my heart.  It is bad Dune, but still
good science-fiction.  It does a good job at creating feelings that drive its
story, even if those are at odds with what's in the book.  For that matter, even
the Denis Villeneuve movie is a pale rendition that skims the surface but lacks
the depth of the original material.  But it still works as its own artistic
endeavor.

_More to come._

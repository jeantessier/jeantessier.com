The book is another collection of essays written by Umberto Eco for various
conferences.  The opening essay, _Inventing the Enemy_, is somewhat
approachable, though he does lay the anti-semitic descriptions rather thick.  By
the time I started the second essay, I was wondering if I had bitten more than I
could chew; a recurring possibility with Eco.

---++ Inventing the Enemy (2008)

We often define ourselves by opposition to an "enemy", often an imaginary one.
We reuse the same tropes to describe this enemy and vilify them, whether the be
Jews, women, Arabs, or other.  The essay is a little rambling, without a clear
conclusion.

---++ Absolute and Relative (2007)

A rather dense discussion of absolutism, relativism, and holistic thinking.  He
cleverly quotes classical and modern writers. Whatever we decide to believe,
there are objective truths in the world that won't be denied, such as death and
solid walls.

---++ The Beauty and the Flame (2008)

The mystical allure of fire.

Fire and light take in various meanings across societies.  Celestial fire and
light is the divine essence to the medieval people.  Fire is knowledge and craft
to the ancient Greeks.  Terrestrial fire is hell to the ancients.  Fire is
transformation to alchemists.  Fire consumes, reveals and is an agent of
creation as well as destruction.  Ekpyrosis: everything comes from fire and will
return to fire.  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

---++ Treasure Hunting (2009, 2011)

Reliquaries are filled with hidden beauties.  Faith makes the relic, not secular
truth.  Politics of the faithful are revealed in the story of relics.

---++ Fermented Delights (2008)

Piero Camporesi loves words; the more rare and forgotten the better.  He loves
food and putrefaction and lists.

---++ No Embryos in Paradise (2008)

St. Thomas Aquinas tackled the problem of when the soul enters the body to make
a human being.  He had vegetative souls for plants, sensitive souls for animals,
and rational souls for humans.  The embryo acquires each then in stages, each
one corrupting and augmenting the previous.

---++ Hugo, H&eacute;las!: The Poetics of Excess

Victor Hugo does not really concern himself with individual struggles.  He uses
massive excesses and seemingly infinite lists to create an impression in the
reader.  His characters are the forces of Fate and Destiny themselves.  Just
like a Beethoven symphony weaves a tapestry of sound to convey a feeling, so
does Hugo with his prose.

---++ Censorship and Silence (2009)

You can censor information by suppressing it, or by burying it with noise.  We
should be mindful of silence to promote better thinking.

---++ Imaginary Astronomies (2001, 2002)

People have filled gaps in knowledge about the heavens and the earth with their
imaginations.  They've also forged histories about them to foster political
agendas.  Prester John's letter helped European expansion into Asia and Africa.

Remember the greatness of those imaginary geographies and astronomies, and those
errors that often bore fruit.

---++ Living by Proverbs (2007)

Taking many proverbs literally yields a funny piece of absurd writing.  Many of
the proverbs seem to come from English, so I'm curious what the original text in
Italian must have looked like.

---++ I Am Edmond Dant&egrave;s (2008)

Anagnorisis is a frequently used literary device that worked well for episodic
feuilleton novels.  It can be overused at times, but is still very powerful.
Anagnorisis is when the reader enjoys deceiving the characters.  Double
anagnorisis is when the author deceives the reader.  Like Oddyseus coming back
to Ithaca.  Also used in manga, another serialized form of story telling.

---++ Ulysses: That's All We Needed... (2009)

James Joyce, as seen by Italian commentators in the fascist years before World
War II.  They criticize him for not being true to what they consider the formal
form of the novel, not being nationalistic enough, and accuse him of being a
Jew.

---++ Why the Island Is Never Found (2011)

Lost islands have long held people's fascination.  For a long time, difficulty
in determining longitude meant that islands were found then lost, misidentified,
confused.

---++ Thoughts on WikiLeaks (2010)

WikiLeaks showed that all Secret Services only repeat information in the public
domain.  Conspirators only believe what they already know.

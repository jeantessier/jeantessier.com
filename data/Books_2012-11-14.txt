I liked [[Books.cgi#The_No_Asshole_Rule][The No Asshole Rule]], so I thought I'd
give this one a try too.





Lincoln, his cabinet, and "Team of Rivals."

Tommy Lasorda and "managing is like holding a bird." First heard in the context of kendo. Don't know if it originated with Lasorda or if they share some common ancestry.



David Kelly (IDEO) and performance / humanity balance. Kyudo and focusing on steps in the process; the results will take care of themselves.



More David Kelley, about sharing credit. Project confidence and you will gain confidence. Reminded me of part in Starship Troopers (book) about how officers always have all the anwers, even when they do not.



Performance evaluation and feedback (Google). Collaborative behavior may be more important then super performance.



Repetitive and concrete advice (keep repeating it). KISS principle.



Stand up meetings (but didn't talk about agile software development).



Management firm Bain. Is this the same as Bain Capital?



Alice Waters and Chez Panisse.



A boss is a job almost designed to generate assholes. Good bosses are more self-aware to note when they misstep and more graceful about accepting and acting on their failings. They surround themselves with people who will keep them grounded. Asshole Tax: charging more when having to deal with assholes. Assholes are costly in churn and lost productivity / innovation.



One manager took subordinates to a hospice to put evaluations in perspective. Imagine, looking back, how your behavior looks to others. Image your child is following you around. Embarrassement and pride can be great motivators.



Acid tests for good boss: 1) Would people work with the boss again? 2) Do they know what it's like working for them?

Chilean miners.



Bosses need to promote performance AND humanity. Google did a survey of good bosses and found technical expertise was dead last criteria, much to their surprise.



Mind set of subtraction: when in doubt, take it out.

Small teams; complexity increases exponentially with team size.

Steve Jobs: too brilliant to be imitated.

Some bosses may owe their success to circumstances more than their skills (Larry Page). Others owe their success to their constant dedication to work and team (Mitchell Baker of Mozilla, Ed Catmull of Pixar).





_More to come._

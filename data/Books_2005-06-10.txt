Second reading.  I first read it as a teenager back in
highschool and I only remember that I had liked it a lot.  Having
mostly forgotten it all, I'm decided to have another go at it and
see if I still relate to it as a grownup.

I have a new found appreciation for the power of metaphor and
the work of the poet.

Some quick, rough notes:

It is pointless for the artist to explain himself to others.
People with the right sensibility will understand on their own
those without will never understand anyway.

_Le voyage_ and the principle of "_la fuite en avant_."

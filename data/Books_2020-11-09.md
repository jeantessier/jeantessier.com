Umberto Eco goes crazy for literary lists.  He talks about lists as a literary
device in Western culture for the past 3,000 years.

Each chapter starts with a short academic piece on a given aspect of lists,
specifically as a literary device.  This is most often followed by excerpts from
the body of Western literature, sometimes going as far back as Antiquity.
Interspersed throughout, there are reproductions of artworks, also taken from
the body of Western culture, sometimes going as far back as Antiquity.  The
academic pieces tend to be rather dense, but still interesting.  They are too
brief to really dig into any given topic or to really educate the reader.  The
excepts can contain a lot of variation, and the context and stylistic switching
is hard on the reader, too.

There is an amazing picture on pages 94-95: _Imaginary View of the Main
Monuments of Italy_ by Petrus Henricus Theodorus Tetar van Elven.  It dates back
to 1858 and shows a number of Italian buildings in a wooded countryside, across
a bay.  I was surprised that I couldn't find anything about it on the Internet.

_More to come._

Umberto Eco goes crazy for literary lists.  He talks about lists as a literary
device in Western culture for the past 3,000 years.

There is an amazing picture on pages 94-95: _Imaginary View of the Main
Monuments of Italy_ by Petrus Henricus Theodorus Tetar van Elven.  It dates back
to 1858 and shows a number of Italian buildings in a wooded countryside, across
a bay.  I was surprised that I couldn't find anything about it on the Internet.

_More to come._

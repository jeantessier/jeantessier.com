I first heard about the idea of the Long Tail on my first day at Google, back in
2005.  I borrowed the book from work, out of curiosity.  The shorter commute and
new friends on the train mean less time for reading, so this one might take me a
bit to get through.

It does a good job describing new businesses that exploit the long tail, like
Amazon and Google.  But it was written just before the explosion of YouTube and
Facebook and Twitter.  Now, more than ever, we're in a world of citizen
journalists and en empowered general population.

_More to come._

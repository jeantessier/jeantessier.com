    <blockquote>
        <p>
            When I was seven, my grandfather sent me a kids' book on
            anthropology.  Each chapter described the fascinating customs and
            creation stories of a different culture.  I saw quickly that each
            culture had a different creation story, that all of them couldn't be
            true so none of them was true, that what was true was that people
            needed stories.  So they made them up.

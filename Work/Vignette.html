<p>I then worked for Epicentric in San Francisco, CA.  Epicentric was acquired
by <a href="http://www.vignette.com/">Vignette</a> in December 2002.</p>

<p>When I joined Epicentric, the Engineering department was in a bullpen in a
bunker.  I liked the bullpen - everyone was close by - but hated the bunker.
We soon moved to a cube farm in a dark basement, but it was an improvement over
the bunker.  Finally, we moved to an upper floor of a modern office building,
in a cube farm with low walls.  Not quite the openess of the bullpen, but still
quite nice.  Here are two incarnations my desk in San Francisco, CA.</p>

<p>The bunker had no window and the basement only had a few at street level.
Very few of the desks could see outside.  Their current facilities have nice
windows all around and are very well lit.  This was the view from my window in
San Francisco, CA.  It showed the Ferry Building, the San Francisco Bay, and
the <a href="../baybridge.html">Bay Bridge</a> in the back.</p>

<p>At Vignette, I got to lock my bike in the basement, near the garbage
compactor.  At LinkedIn and Google, I can leave my bike in the building, close
by from my desk.</p>

            I worked at Epicentric in San Francisco, CA starting in 2000.  It
            was acquired by <a href="http://www.vignette.com/">Vignette</a> in
            late 2002 and I left in 2004.

            When I joined Epicentric, the Engineering department was in a
            bullpen in a bunker.  I liked the bullpen - everyone was close by -
            but hated the bunker.  We soon moved to a cube farm in a dark
            basement, but it was an improvement over the bunker.  Finally, we
            moved to an upper floor of a modern office building, in a cube farm
            with low walls.  Not quite the openess of the bullpen, but still
            quite nice.  Here are two incarnations my desk in San Francisco, CA.

            The bunker had no window and the basement only had a few at street
            level.  Very few of the desks could see outside.  Their current
            facilities have nice windows all around and are very well lit.  This
            was the view from my window in San Francisco, CA.  It showed the
            Ferry Building, the San Francisco Bay, and the
            <a href="baybridge.html">Bay Bridge</a> in the back.

            At Vignette, I got to lock my bike in the basement, near the garbage
            compactor.  At LinkedIn and Google, I can leave my bike in the
            building, close by from my desk.

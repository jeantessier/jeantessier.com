            I have been working at <a href="https://artafinance.com/">Arta
            Finance</a> in Mountain View, CA, since June 2022.

            Arta's office is downtown Mountain View, on top of a restaurant.
            With the COVID-19 pandemic easing up, we're trying to work from the
            office three days a week.  I'm back on my bicycle!  (The first few
            days were tough since I'm a bit out of shape.  I'm trying out a
            Kinesis Advantage2 keyboard and I have to retrain some of my
            keyboard habits.

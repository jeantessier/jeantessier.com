<p>I worked at <a href="http://gusto.com/">Gusto</a> in San Francisco, CA, from
October 2019 until October 2021.</p>

<p>Gusto's San Francisco office is on historic Pier 70, in the old machine shop
of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem_Shipbuilding_Corporation">Bethlehem Shipbuilding</a>'s
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Iron_Works">Union Iron Works</a>
shipyard.  We got to enjoy a giant gantry crane, rated for 50 tons, suspended
above our heads every day.  The Historical Society wouldn't let us play with it,
though.  :-(</p>

<p>I only got to enjoy this office for a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic
forced us all to work from home, starting in March 2020.</p>

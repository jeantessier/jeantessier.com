        <h2>New Jersey</h2>

        <div class="wide">
            In New Jersey, I could see New York City from my apartment's living
            room.
        </div>

        <div class="wide">
            In New Jersey, my home office was in a spare bedroom at first, until
            my first child was born.  The office was then moved to a corner of
            the living room.

        <h2>California</h2>

        <div class="wide">
            In California, I rent a three-bedroom house with a yard in a quiet
            suburb.

            At first, the two kids were in one bedroom, which left one for my
            home office again.  My dad had made the desk custom for the New
            Jersey living room, but it fit perfectly in the new bedroom.

            But with the new baby, I had to move my office to the unused end of
            the laundry room, move the kids to where my office had been, and
            turn their old room into the nursery.  My dad's custom desk didn't
            quite fit, so I had leave out one section.

            This was my setup during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and I had to
            work from home.  My daughter is away in college and my home office
            is back in the now spare bedroom.  That's a guest bed in the
            picture, not my actual bed that I actually sleep in.  The downside
            is that every time we have visitors, I have to give up my office.

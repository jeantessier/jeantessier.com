<h1 class="highlight">Jean Tessier @ Google</h1>
</div>

<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> in Mountain View,
CA, from 2005 until 2009.</p>

<p>At Google, I started next door from the CEO.  Literally, we shared a wall.
He was alone in his office, I shared mine with four other developers (we had
the larger corner office).  The workstation is top notch, with two 24"
flatscreen monitors.  Multi-headed monsters rule!  Things are mobile at Google
and I'm back in a bullpen, and loving it.</p>

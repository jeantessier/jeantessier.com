            I worked at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> in Mountain
            View, CA, from 2005 until 2009.

            At Google, I started next door from the CEO.  Literally, we shared a
            wall.  He was alone in his office, I shared mine with four other
            developers (we had the larger corner office).  Mine's the one with
            the welcome balloons, facing the window.

            Later, we were moved a few doors down the hall and some other team
            got to brag about being next to the CEO.  I got a window seat,
            again.

            During my commute with Caltrain, I snatched this nice sunset picture
            one evening at the Mountain View station.

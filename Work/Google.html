<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> in Mountain View,
CA, from 2005 until 2009.</p>

<p>At Google, I started next door from the CEO.  Literally, we shared a wall.
He was alone in his office, I shared mine with four other developers (we had
the larger corner office).  Mine's the one with the welcome balloons, facing the
window.</p>

<p>Later, we were moved a few doors down the hall and some other team got to
brag about being next to the CEO.  I got a window seat, again.</p>

<p>The workstation is top notch, with two 24" flatscreen monitors.  Multi-headed
monsters rule!</p>

<p>Things are mobile at Google and I'm back in a bullpen, and loving it.</p>

<p>During my commute with Caltrain, I snatched this nice sunset picture one
evening at the Mountain View station.</p>

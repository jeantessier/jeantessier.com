<p>I have been working at <a href="https://arbo.works/">Arbo</a> in Mountain
View, CA, since June 2022.</p>

<p>Arbo's office is downtown Mountain View, on top of a restaurant.  With the
COVID-19 pandemic easing up, we're trying to work from the office three days a
week.  I'm back on my bicycle!  (The first few days were tough since I'm a bit
out of shape.  I'm trying out a Kinesis Advantage2 keyboard and I have to
retrain some of my keyboard habits.</p>

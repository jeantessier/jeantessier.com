<p>I have been working at <a href="http://insidr.net/">Insidr</a> in San Francisco, CA,
since December 2010.</p>

<p>We're squatting the offices of <a href="http://roimarketinginc.com/">ROI Marketing</a>.</p>

<p>I use the same development platform I did at <a href="ShopWell.html">ShopWell</a>:
a MacBook Pro laptop with a 24" monitor and Amazon EC2.  The monitor I used at
ShopWell I had bought with my own money, so I took it back with me when I left.
And I managed to buy my laptop back from them, which I now use at Insidr.  So it
<emp>is</emp> the exact same platform.  :-)</p>

<p>I have been working at <a href="http://directly.com/">Directly</a> in San Francisco, CA,
since December 2010.</p>

<p>We're squatting the offices of <a href="http://roidna.com/">ROI DNA</a>.
Their CEO, Matt Querie, goes back a long time with Antony and Jeff.  The first
office was just around the corner from my old office back at
<a href="Vignette.html">Epicentric</a>.  It was nice to rediscover the old
neighborhood.  And then ROI DNA decided to move so they could expand and had us
move with them.  Remember the dark basement, back at Epicentric?  Yep, that's
were we are now.  Ten years later and my desk has moved twenty feet.  Only now,
the basement has been fully remodeled.  Our suite is half the basement (the half
with the windows) and the new paint makes it a lot brighter.</p>

<p>At first, I used the same development platform I did at
<a href="ShopWell.html">ShopWell</a>: a MacBook Pro laptop with a 24" monitor
and Amazon EC2.  The monitor I used at ShopWell I had bought with my own money,
so I took it back with me when I left.  And I managed to buy my laptop back from
them, which I then used at Directly.  So it <em>was</em> the actual same
hardware.  :-)</p>

<p>Since then, I've upgraded to a MacBook Pro with retina display and a 27"
monitor.  The laptop uses SSD instead of a spinning hard disk, so it is really
fast and really quiet.</p>

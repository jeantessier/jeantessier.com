<p>I have been working at <a href="http://directly.com/">Directly</a> in San
Francisco and Palo Alto, CA, since December 2010.</p>

<p>We're squatting the offices of <a href="http://cyngn.com/">Cyanogen Inc</a>,
the company behind <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod</a>.  They
are kind enough to let us use a few desks in their Palo Alto, CA office.</p>

<p>Before that, we were squatting the offices of <a href="http://roidna.com/">ROI
DNA</a> in San Francisco, CA.  Their CEO, Matt Querie, goes back a long time with
Antony and Jeff.  The first office was just around the corner from my old office
back at <a href="Vignette.html">Epicentric</a>.  It was nice to rediscover the
old neighborhood.  But then ROI DNA decided to move so they could expand and had
us move with them.  Remember the dark basement, back at Epicentric?  Yep, that's
were they went next.  Ten years later and my desk had moved twenty feet.  Only
now, the basement had been fully remodeled.  Our suite was half the basement
(the half with the windows) and the new paint made it a lot brighter.</p>

</p>

<p>When I started with Directly, I used the same development platform I had at
<a href="ShopWell.html">ShopWell</a>: a MacBook Pro laptop with a 24" monitor
and Amazon EC2.  The monitor I used at ShopWell I had bought with my own money,
so I took it back with me when I left.  And I managed to buy my laptop back from
them, which I then used at Directly.  So it <em>was</em> the actual same
hardware.  :-)</p>

<p>Since then, I've upgraded to a MacBook Pro with retina display and a 27"
monitor.  The laptop uses SSD instead of a spinning hard disk, so it is really
fast and really quiet.</p>

<p>Shortly after we moved to Palo Alto, CA, my bicycle got stolen when I locked
it on a public bike rack right outside the office.  I had to get a new bike and
Clovis and I built a custom bike rack so I can keep it safe in the office.</p>

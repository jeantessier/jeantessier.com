<p>I worked at <a href="../att.html">AT&amp;T</a> in Holmdel, NJ and Menlo Park,
CA, from 1995 until 2000.</p>

<p>In Holmdel, NJ, I shared an office with a coworker.  When I moved to Menlo
Park, CA, I shared a small room with two other people before finally getting my
own office.  It had a door that I could close (but not lock).  Here is a
picture of me in that office in Menlo Park, CA.</p>

<p>In Holmdel, NJ, none of the offices had windows.  In Menlo Park, CA, pretty
much all the offices had a window, except for the small room I occupied upon my
arrival.  This was the view from my window in Menlo Park, CA.  It opened on the
courtyard in the middle of the building which had a water fountain in the
center.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, I had to drive to work.  There was a lot of parking space
around the building.</p>

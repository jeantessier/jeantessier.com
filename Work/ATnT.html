        <div class="wide">
            I worked at AT&amp;T in Holmdel, NJ and Menlo Park, CA, from 1995 until
            2000.
        </div>

        <div class="wide">
            In Holmdel, NJ, I shared an office with a coworker.  When I moved to
            Menlo Park, CA, I shared a small room with two other people before
            finally getting my own office.  It had a door that I could close
            (but not lock).  Here is a picture of me in that office in Menlo
            Park, CA.

        </div>

        <div class="wide">
            In Holmdel, NJ, none of the offices had windows.  In Menlo Park, CA,
            pretty much all the offices had a window, except for the small room
            I occupied upon my arrival.  This was the view from my window in
            Menlo Park, CA.  It opened on the courtyard in the middle of the
            building which had a water fountain in the center.

        <div class="wide">
            In New Jersey, I had to drive to work.  There was a lot of parking
            space around the building.

<h1>Agile Software Development</h1>

</div>

<blockquote class="content">

<p>The agile movement attempts to move software development away from large
presriptive processes and towards processes that are more responsive to change.
Change is a fact of life and a realiy of modern business.  We might as well
embrace it.  A number of methodologies have sprung up, each with their own
characteristics.</p>

<p>The agile movement is defined in the
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>.  They promote short
and frequent iterations for rapid feedback and responsiveness.  Two techniques
in particular have emerged from the agile movement.
<a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">Refactoring</a> applies successive
transformations to the code to keep it as simple as possible while maintaining
behavior.
<a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">Test-Driven Development</a>
makes you write a test before the code which it verifies.  Together, they have
defined a new coding cycle for agile developers:</p>

<p><a href="http://testdriven.com"><img src="http://testdriven.com/programs/imtd2.gif" border="1" alt="I'm test-driven!"></a></p>

<ol>
    <li>write a test</li>
    <li>write just enough code to make the test pass</li>
    <li>refactor all the code and tests mercilessly</li>
    <li>repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>In recent years, a movement for
<a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/main">Software Craftsmanship</a>
has emerged, with a large intersection with the people in the agile
movement.</p>

<p>Here are some of the more widely known methodologies:</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> (XP)</dt>
<dd>The one that started it all.  It takes practices that make sense at first
glance, an pushes them to their extreme.  Highly controversial, many say that
it is only glorified hacking.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.poppendieck.com/lean.htm">Lean Programming</a></dt>
<dd>What <em>modern</em> manufacturing can teach software developers.  Focus on
activities that produce value and aggressively cut down on things that don't
add value.</dd>
<dd>I attended a <a href="bayxp.20040315.html">presentation</a> by lean
programming proponent Mary Poppendieck.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">Scrum</a></dt>
<dd>List features for roughly one month's worth of work, an run with it.  For
one month, the development team cannot be distracted and works in virtual
isolation.  Someone called it the planning game from XP without all the other,
code-related practices.</dd>

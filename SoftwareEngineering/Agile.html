    <h1>Agile Software Development</h1>

    <div class="main-text">

        <div class="wide">
            The agile movement attempts to move software development away from
            large presriptive processes and towards processes that are more
            responsive to change.  Change is a fact of life and a reality of
            modern business.  We might as well embrace it.  A number of
            methodologies have sprung up, each with their own characteristics.

        <div class="wide">
            The agile movement is defined in the
            <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>.  They
            promote short and frequent iterations for rapid feedback and
            responsiveness.  Two techniques in particular have emerged from the
            agile movement.
            <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">Refactoring</a> applies
            successive transformations to the code to keep it as simple as
            possible while maintaining behavior.
            <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">Test-Driven Development</a>
            makes you write a test before the code which it verifies.  Together,
            they have defined a new coding cycle for agile developers:

            <ol>
                <li>write a test</li>
                <li>write just enough code to make the test pass</li>
                <li>refactor all the code and tests mercilessly</li>
                <li>repeat</li>

        <div class="wide">
            In recent years, a movement for
            <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/main">Software Craftsmanship</a>
            has emerged, with a large intersection with the people in the agile
            movement.

                <dd>The one that started it all.  It takes practices that make sense at first
                    glance, an pushes them to their extreme.  Highly controversial, many say that
                    it is only glorified hacking.</dd>

                <dd>What <em>modern</em> manufacturing can teach software developers.  Focus on
                    activities that produce value and aggressively cut down on things that don't
                    add value.</dd>
                <dd>I attended a <a href="bayxp.20040315.html">presentation</a> by lean

                    one month, the development team cannot be distracted and works in virtual
                    isolation.  Someone called it the planning game from XP without all the other,
                    code-related practices.</dd>

As a fallout of the change in company culture at Basecamp, their employees are
leaving in droves.  Twitter is filled with messages where people are announcing
they are leaving and explicitly mention the change in company policy.  Basecamp
is not a large company.  I foresee some hard times ahead as the people left
behind scramble to pick up the work of those who left.  I guess there will be
opportunities for those who've always dreamt of working with DHH and Jason Fried
and still want to.

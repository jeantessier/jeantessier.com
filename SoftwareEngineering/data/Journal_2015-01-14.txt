I want to start a side project to try out the latest technologies.

    * Responsive frontend
    * Single page app with Ajax communication to the server
    * Grails 2 on the server
    * NoSQL database (possibly more than one, like Redis + MongoDB)

I found a great link
[[http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis][comparing NoSQL databases]].

I'm thinking the project should have the following general steps:

    1 General requirements (what will it do)
    1 Wireframes (operations with very rough screens)
    1 Low-fi design (general page and panel structure)
    1 Data model (information flow between database and frontend)
    1 Wire in slices of functionality one by one (rough frontend, middleware, database)
    1 Find somewhere to host it all at no additional cost

The whole thing would have to be in Github, of course.

An obvious candidate is to redo my website.  Or at least the blog and books read
sections.

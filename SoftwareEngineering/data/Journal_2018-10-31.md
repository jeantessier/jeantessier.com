I watched another great [talk on microservices](https://youtu.be/j6ow-UemzBc),
this time by Michael Bryzek of [Flow](https://www.flow.io/).  They take
development based on microservices to the next level.  They start by defining
artifacts (APIs, events, etc.) using language-agnostic descriptors in JSON and
using code generation to automate all the glue code.  Very impressive.

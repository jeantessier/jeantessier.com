I learned
[Microsoft was acquiring GitHub](https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/1003432099855167488)
through a tweet from Sam Newman.  I only see second hand mentions on the
Internet; nothing on the GitHub blog.  I'm not sure if I should believe it.  I
know I don't want to believe it.

It started with
[rumors from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422752/microsoft-github-acquisition-rumors).

I'm writing a microservice for work.  It does its main communication through
RabbitMQ, but it also has a small admin UI.  I am building the microservice is
with Grails and I am using _scaffolding_ to generate the admin UI automatically.

We want to limit access to the admin UI, but we also want to keep the
microservice as simple as possible.  I don't want to duplicate user management
or maintain a separate set of user credentials.  So I figured I could connect
to the company's LDAP server instead.  Grails has plugins built on top of
Spring Security to interface with LDAP.

I am running a local LDAP server using
[OpenLDAP on Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/osixia/openldap/), and I found
two free LDAP clients,
[Apache Directory Studio](https://directory.apache.org/studio/) and
[jXplorer](http://jxplorer.org/), to help me set it up.  But, I am still at
a loss to understand how to setup user accounts and groups that will map to
users and roles in Grails.

When I connect to the company's LDAP server, I can sign in with my company
credentials, but I am not picking up roles from the LDAP data.  I still have
work to do to setup a local system to test against.  LDAP is not so simple;
it's X.500 roots are showing.  The only thing more convoluted than "design by
committee" is "design by _international_ committee".  (Full disclosure: I worked
on [X.462](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.462/en), the ITU standard for
managing X.400 email.)

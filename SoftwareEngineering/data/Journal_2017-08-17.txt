I learned about [[https://github.com/prettier/prettier][Prettier]], a code
formatter for JavaScript that is a little less opinionated than
[[https://standardjs.com/][JavaScript Standard Style]].  It has a really nice
integration with the Atom editor.  And it lets me fine tune some of the rules
(that's what I mean by _less opinionated).  It won't automatically convert your
callbacks to ES6 arrow functions, though.

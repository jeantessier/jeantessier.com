Ten years ago, I read
[[Books.cgi#Working%5FEffectively%5Fwith%5FLegacy%5FCode][Working Effectively with Legacy Code]]
by Michael Feathers and really liked it.  It had a strong focus on tests and
refactoring.  I'm hoping this is an updated take on the subject, though the
table of contents makes it more about the human factors involved.  This is a
problem that I'm currently struggling with: how to modernize a sizeable code
base that is too unwieldy for my small team.

Last month, a coworker and I got into an argument regarding the use of
interfaces versus abstract base classes.  We came to the realization that my
coworker wants to expose the minimum API possible, taking into account issues
of backward compatibility, whereas I want to grant maximum freedom to our
customers.  These two goals are not always easy to reconcile.  Today, I found
a [[http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude.html][bliki entry]]
on [[MartinFowler.html][Martin Fowler]]'s website that sums
it up pretty well.  He calls it the directing attitude (my cowoker) versus the
enabling attitude (me).

I don't care much for the work ethics in software that make it cool for
someone to sacrifice their personal life to the company.  Why would you give up
everything that makes you a balanced individual to benefit a faceless
corporation that will throw you away like a used towel the moment you are no
longer worth their while?  I've seen it with large corporations and I've seen
it with startups.  What you put into your personal life will come back to you
throughout your life.  What you put into a company will most likely never come
back to you, unless you happen to own the company, and I don't mean owning a
few thousand shares.

If you don't look out for yourself, nobody else will.

It's OK to go beyond the call of duty on occasion, as long as you stand to
benefit from it in some remote fashion.  But don't lose sight of your own best
interest, don't let it get to a point where you are just being used.  The
others are in it for themselves, not for you.  Stay with them only for as long
as your goals lie in the same direction as theirs.

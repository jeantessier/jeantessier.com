[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is replacing ZooKeeper with a variation of
the Raft protocol to manage the brokers.  I played with the Docker image by
[Bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kafka).  I can now setup a Kafka
system as a single process.  And it uses a volume inside Docker to store the
data separate from the running container.  I should find out what it takes to
reset the topics.

I also found out we can now use [`kcat`](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat) to
setup a
[temporary in-memory Kafka system](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat#run-a-mock-kafka-cluster)
suitable for end-to-end testing.

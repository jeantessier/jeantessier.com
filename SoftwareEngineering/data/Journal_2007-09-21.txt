It's alive!

My Alienware computer is alive again!

I put in the new drive, but the computer wouldn't start.  I needed to use the
floppy drive in a pinch, so I decided to re-install Windows again so at least
I could copy a file from my USB thumbdrive to a floppy.  So I put the old
hard-drive in and ran the Windows recovery CD.  Somehow, that fixed the boot
sequence and next thing I know the computer is booting from the image on the
hard-disk.  All the drivers are setup correctly.  Oh joy!  Now, I bought a
250GB hard-drive for nothing.  Ah well, maybe I can find a way to make it work
as a secondary drive or something.

All I have left to do is reinstall everything: games, apps, patches, data...

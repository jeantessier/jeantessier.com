The new [[https://launch.micronaut.io/][Micronaut Launch]] site lets you create
Micronaut projects without having to install Micronaut a priori.  It works
similar to the [[http://start.grails.org/][Grails Application Forge]].  You pick
all your configuration options and it gives you a ZIP file with the initial app
that the framework would have generated.

You can use =curl= (or HTTPie) to call it from a script.

I have a handful of starter Micronaut apps that I use to try out various
features (GORM, Data, RabbitMQ).  I try to upgrade them every time Micronaut
deploys a new version.  Each time, I'll create a blank app with the old version,
a blank app  with the new version, and use =diff= to see what's changed.  I try
my best to apply the changes to my starter apps.  I have scripts to automate the
more tedious parts, but they require that I have both versions of Micronaut
installed.  With Micronaut Launch, I could simply download the blank apps
instead of creating them locally.

One current limitation is that Micronaut Launch only does version 2.0 of
Micronaut.  I took a quick look at the Swagger docs but I couldn't find a way to
pass in the target version of Micronaut.

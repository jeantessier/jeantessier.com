Read a little bit about [[http://groovy.codehaus.org/][Groovy]] and
[[http://grails.org/][Grails]].  From what little I saw, Grails has *a lot* in
common with Ruby on Rails.

Looked into [[http://hadoop.apache.org/][Hadoop]], a Java implementation of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapreduce][MapReduce]].  I was able to run a
simple example on one machine, straight out of the box.  MapReduce is very cool
technology.

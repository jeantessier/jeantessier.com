Read a little bit about [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and
[Grails](http://grails.org/).  From what little I saw, Grails has **a lot** in
common with Ruby on Rails.

Looked into [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/), a Java implementation of
[MapReduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapreduce).  I was able to run a
simple example on one machine, straight out of the box.  MapReduce is very cool
technology.

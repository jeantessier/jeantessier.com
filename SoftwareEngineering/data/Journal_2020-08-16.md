Came upon the term _descriptive feedback_.

I've always thought of critique and criticism as encompassing both negative and
positive opinions.  An artistic critique could be just as much about why someone
liked a piece of art as it could be about why they didn't like it.  For any
complex experience, there are bound to be parts that resonate with you and you
thought were well done, and parts that didn't and you thought could have been
different.

But, at least in American English, it is usually reserved for the negative
opinions only.  I remember Harry Connick Jr. being a judge on _American  Idol_
saying how he had liked a specific performance and therefore he didn't want to
critique it.  I was shocked that he would not elaborate about how that
performance had been so successful.  It was a missed opportunity to provide
feedback to the artist, to point out what specifically had made the performance
work so well.

Maybe I can lean on the term _descriptive feedback_ as a better descriptor of
having a more measured evaluation of some action or product and dig into the
details of what works and what maybe doesn't work.

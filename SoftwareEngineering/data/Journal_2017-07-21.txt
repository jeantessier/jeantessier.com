Catching up on Groovy news, I found an
[[https://yermilov.github.io/blog/2017/06/27/groovy-static-sites-with-grain/][article about Grain]].
It is a Groovy equivalent to [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]].  You download a
pre-configured theme with a =grainw= wrapper that automatically downloads the
right version of Grain.  I had to upgrade its Gradle version from 1.8 to 4.0.1
to get it to work, but otherwise it was fine.  It can generate the all-static
website and it can also automate its deployment to GitHub Pages.

The article also mentions [[https://travis-ci.org/][Travis]], a kind of free
Jenkins that's integrated with GitHub.  It can monitor your project and trigger
activity on commits.  It is getting easier and easier to develop pet projects
for free but still with top of the line infrastructure: repo, CI, etc.

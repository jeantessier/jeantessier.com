Catching up on Groovy news, I found an
[[https://yermilov.github.io/blog/2017/06/27/groovy-static-sites-with-grain/][article about Grain]].
It is a Groovy equivalent to [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]].  You download a
pre-configured theme with a =grainw= wrapper that automatically downloads the
right version of Grain.  I had to upgrade its Gradle version from 1.8 to 4.0.1
to get it to work, but otherwise it was fine.  It can generate the all-static
website and it can also automate its deployment to GitHub Pages.

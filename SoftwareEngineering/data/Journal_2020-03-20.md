First time I heard about
[Data Distribution Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Distribution_Service)
(DDS) as an alternative to doing messaging with other technologies, like
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).  DDS comes from OMG, the same people
who gave us
[CORBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture),
back in the 90's, and somewhat builds on top of CORBA-related artifacts.  CORBA
was overly complex and its binary aspect made it very difficult to debug.  I
suspect that DDS suffers from the same ailments.

Here is a [slide deck](https://docs.huihoo.com/opensplice/DDS-vs-AMQP.pdf)
that compares DDS with AMQP (the model and protocol behind RabbitMQ).

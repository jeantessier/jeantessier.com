Got a signed copy from my good friend Dave Astels.  I got exposed to
[RSpec](http://rspec.info/) back on
[2008-11-07](Journal.html#2008-11-07) and I have been waiting for this book
ever since.  I wish there was an RSpec for Java or Groovy.  I heard that
[JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) is supposed to be similar, but the syntax is
not the same.  RSpec reads just like English, with spaces and all!

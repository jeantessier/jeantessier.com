I realized I'm working with the author of [JsUnit](http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/),
[Edward Hieatt](http://www.edwardh.com/).  He leads a small group
that does eXtreme Programming and it is quite refreshing to have somebody else
push for XP practices, for a change.  He and the rest of his group are pretty
smart and it is a joy to work with them.  We share many points of view when it
comes to developing software.

He has a nice sideline going on at [agilestuff.com](http://www.agilestuff.com).

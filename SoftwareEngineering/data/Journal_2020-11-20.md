I found an interesting feature of
[Apollo's GraphQL federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).
One service can extend a type to add a field that is computed from other fields
on that type, where these other fields come from outside the service.  I noticed
it while I was looking at the
[code samples for federation in Ruby](https://github.com/Gusto/apollo-federation-ruby/blob/401ab8eadb4acf1a612c91432f5044c0dbfe6da2/example/inventory.rb#L7-L10).

As an example, I created a `users` service that has a user's name and email
address, and a `signatures` service that adds a formated signature to the `User`
type.  The `signatures` service doesn't have data of its own; it uses the name
and email address it obtains from the `users` service.

There are some limitations.  The source fields can only come from the source
service, the one that resolves `@key` for that type.  And I haven't found a way
to have source fields of complex types.  I've only been able to make it work for
fields of scalar types: strings and integers.

I went to Alan Shalloway's talk on "Transitioning to Agile".  It was in a
small room in a community center in Palo Alto.  The walls had kids' artwork.
It was very simple settings, which I didn't mind at all.  It brought a very
human dimension to the event.  Alan apologized profusely about the facilities.
Granted they did not scream "professional", but I liked them nonetheless.  The
talk was instructive, even though I already knew most of the material from
reading Alistair Cockburn's _Agile Software Development_.  It dwelt more
on what agile _is_ than really transitioning, but that was OK given it
was a free seminar.

I started to read Alan's book, _Design Patterns Explained_, on the
train before going to the seminar.  He described the epiphany he had while
learning about design patterns, that you should try to encapsulate the part
that changes.  This is what I learned when I read Wolfgang Pree's book on
meta-patterns.  Alan mentioned at the seminar that he thought _Design Patterns_
by the Gang of Four had been hard to read.  Pree's book is much
harder still; it reads more like the guy's Ph.D. thesis.  But the core material
about hooks and hot spots in frameworks is so important that I think everyone
should read it to really understand the essence of building flexible software.
But it is not easily accessible to everyone, I must concede.

I spend the week working on code to upload images in React and saving them to
S3 using a Node backend.

The frontend used `react-dropzone` so users could drag and drop images to a
dropzone on the page.  The submit handler function would call an endpoint to
upload the image, get a URL back, and call another endpoint so save the URL in a
related entity.

The backend used `formidable` to receive the file and `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` to
funnel it to S3.  With a little tweaking, no part of the file ever touches the
disk on the server; it is all streamed to S3 using a memory buffer.

I also tried to set up something similar in Ruby on Rails, using
[Active Storage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html).
I used the default SQLite in-process database, and I let Active Storage save
blobs to the local disk.  This way, I could hypothetically deploy my app to a
single server with a disk that is large enough; it wouldn't need a separate
database server or use additional storage in S3.  Its infrastructure needs are
extremely simple.  Backups consist of just archiving a disk volume.

This setup should be sufficient for an internal app with a few hundred users.
It doesn't do drag-and-drop, but I got everything up and running on my laptop in
a couple of hours, including sifting my way through documentations and asking
Claude AI when I got stuck.  Compare that with setting up React and Node and AWS
and juggling keys and secrets around.

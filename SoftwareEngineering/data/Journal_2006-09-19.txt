Played with Selenium.

Looked at [[http://testng.org][TestNG]].  Noticed how they use annotations to
earmark the tests and fixture methods.

Took another at [[http://junit.org][Junit 4.1]].  Played with it a bit in order
to try using annotations.  It was not so easy since they actually removed many
of the familiar trappings of JUnit 3.  Gone is the Swing =TestRunner=.  All
that is left is the text runner and now it is called
=org.junit.runner.JUnitCore=.  Go figure.

I remember being fairly disappointed that JUnit had gone the route of
annotations.  It makes life harder for tool makers.  :-)

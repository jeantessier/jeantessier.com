After reading a few articles by DHH on
[[https://m.signalvnoise.com/@dhh][Medium]], I figured I'd look at his books.

This book is about the corporate culture at [[http://37signals.com/][37signals]]
and how it differs from traditional top-down structures and trying to plan
everything.  I'm hoping it resonates with what I experienced at Google.

Found a new tool for formatting code snippets:
[[https://carbon.now.sh/][Carbon]].  Before, there was GitHub
[[https://gist.github.com/][Gist]] to render code with syntax highlighting.  But
the snippet was hosted on GitHub and the embedded view was branded by GitHub.
With Carbon, you get an unbranded image that you can host anywhere and load
with a simple =&lt;img&gt;= tag.  They cover an expansive list of languages and
have multiple styles; though most are dark, I prefer "Solarized (Light)".

In the past, I thought you needed a separate gist for each code snippet.  But
the latest GitHub UI lets you put multiple files in a single gist.

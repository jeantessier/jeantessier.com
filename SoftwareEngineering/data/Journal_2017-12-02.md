Another
[nice article](https://hackernoon.com/how-css-grid-beats-bootstrap-85d5881cf163)
on [Grid Layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) that shows the
difference with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).  One nice thing for
Grid Layout is that it is already in the browser, so it doesn't need an
additional library.

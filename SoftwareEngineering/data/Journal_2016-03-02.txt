Discovered [[http://pusher.com][Pusher]], a messaging service that connects
frontends to backends using websockets.  The backend publishes messages to
Pusher which distribute it to clients.  They have libraries for most popular
frontend and backend stacks, and someone even wrote a
[[https://github.com/micpango/pusher-plugin][Grails plugin]] for it.

At Directly, I built a pull mechanism using jQuery that would call a _heartbeat_
controller on the server every few seconds.  The lag was annoying and making it
too small created unwanted load on the server.  This solution uses websockets,
but Pusher's servers handle the websockets, not the servers hosting the app.

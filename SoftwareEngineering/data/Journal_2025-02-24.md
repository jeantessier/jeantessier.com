I am having trouble installing the `rdkafka` gem.  While `sassc` was using the
`CC` and `CXX` config settings to find the C and C++ compilers, `rdkafka` goes
straight for `gcc` and `g++` from the GNU C Compiler.  I used Homebrew to
install the GNU C Compiler, but the executables are named `gcc-14` and `g++-14`.
I will need to figure out how to install the GNU C Compiler so its executables
can take precedence over `clang`.

The problem is that Xcode installed its own `clang`, `clang++`, `gcc`, and `g++`
executables, but not the C++ Standard Library.  As a result, there are many
common libraries it cannot find, like `<iostream>` and `<string>`.  I was able
to install LLVM and put its `clang` and `clang++` executables earlier in my
`PATH`.

For `gcc` and `g++`, I ended up creating symlinks in `~/bin` to `gcc-14` and
`g++-14` respectively, and them moved `~/bin` ahead of `/usr/bin` in my `PATH`.

With this setup, I was able to upgrade all my Ruby projects to Ruby `3.4.2`.

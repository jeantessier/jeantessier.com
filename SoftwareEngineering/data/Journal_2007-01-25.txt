I just realized that I've been working with Alex Martelli, author of some of the
most popular books on Python, for the past six months and I didn't even
realize it.  He wrote or co-wrote:

    * [[http://amzn.com/0596100469][Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0596007973][Python Cookbook]]

What a small world.

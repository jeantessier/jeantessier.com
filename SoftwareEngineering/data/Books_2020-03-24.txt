Self-published, so the page setting is a little strange (I suspect LaTeX) and
the text could have used some editing.  But the author built GraphQL APIs at
Spotify and GitHub, so he knows his material.

He advocates for building APIs that are as specific as possible, instead of
generic ones.  Especially when it comes to mutations.  The more specific the
better.

There is a complex description of using cursor-based pagination instead of the
more common ones that use an offset.  They are more resilient to cases where new
data gets added or removed in the list while paging through it.

There is an interesting bit about how to deal with errors.  The author
distinguishes between _client_ errors, essentially protocol errors, and _user_
errors, errors in the business logic.  E.g., email already in use, password too
weak.

_More to come._

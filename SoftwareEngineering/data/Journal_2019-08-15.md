I was reading
[an article on cultural fit](https://hackernoon.com/not-a-cultural-fit-bf398bc0e99b)
where they talked about the gig economy and how "individual employees [...]
should think of themselves as businesses."  This brought to my mind Reid
Hoffman's [The Start-Up of You](http://amzn.com/0307888908).  But the article
showed that the idea went back much farther, mentioning the
[Mount Pelerin Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society),
a liberal group of philosophers that started in 1947.  An interesting discovery.

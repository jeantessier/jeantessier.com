I attended a webcast by Robert C. Martin on
[[http://webevents.broadcast.com/cmp/wcs/detail.asp?event_id=11483][the intersection of agility, objects, and UML]].
He was his usual perky self and a lot of his material was the usual stuff
about OO principles and dependency management.  He threw in some updated
additions, mentioning Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and aspects.  I was at
work with some coworkers.  They expressed some skepticism about the feasability
of fully automated acceptance tests and whether or not his approach to
documentation (or lack thereof) is realisic.  For my part, I was pleased with
the talk.  The tone was relaxed and the contents very informative.

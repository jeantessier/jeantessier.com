I play sudoku online with [Count to Nine](http://counttonine.com/).  It turns
out that one of the site's owner, Wayne Crosby, is a coworker of mine.  I was
playing a quick game during a game when he dropped by and asked me if I liked
that site.  He then mentioned that it was his site.  I was pleasantly
surprised.

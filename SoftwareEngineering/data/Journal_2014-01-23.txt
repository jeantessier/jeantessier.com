I found out about [[http://asciidoc.org/][AsciiDoc]], another tool to convert
plain text to HTML.  At first look, it appears richer than
[[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]], and some of its
syntax is very close to what I've been using.  It can generate PDF in addition
to HTML.

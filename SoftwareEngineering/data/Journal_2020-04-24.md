I tried different ways to render the Ruby code snippet from yesterday.  Once
with [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) and another way with a
[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

Here is the result with Carbon:

![data-driven-rspec](data-driven-rspec.png)

It looks nice, but it's an image.  That means it will not match keyword searches
and people cannot cut-and-paste it into their code.

I tried to embed the
[Gist](https://gist.github.com/jeantessier/c514cbb2071bf7badbc6356fc4210313)
into this blog, but this is done with a `<script>` tag.  This blog happens
to be a small [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) app that sanitizes data, so
it scrubs out the tag to prevent XSS exploits.

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/jeantessier/c514cbb2071bf7badbc6356fc4210313.js"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jeantessier/c514cbb2071bf7badbc6356fc4210313.js"></script>

I looked for ways to mark the blog content as trusted HTML, or even to turn off
sanitization altogether, but no success.  This is AngularJS, old technology.  I
could rewrite the app using [Angular](https://angular.io/).  Maybe the
sanitization controls are easier to operate there.  And, there is always
[React](https://reactjs.org/).

[Martin Fowler](MartinFowler.html) published
[an article on waterfall software development](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WaterfallProcess.html).
He tries really hard to find the positive in the waterfall process and not
dismiss it outright.  The
[comments on Twitter](https://twitter.com/martinfowler/status/1194649511609733129)
are not so kind.  One commenter brought up a memory of RUP, to which another
commenter added Rational Rose nightmares.  In the 90's, I was looking hard into
RUP and I was an avid user of Rational Rose.  I might have outgrown these
childish things, but I can still find a flicker of them in
[SAFe](https://scaledagileframework.com/).

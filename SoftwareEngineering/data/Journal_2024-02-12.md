I saw
[a message a Mastodon](https://techhub.social/@ruby_discussions@mastodon.social/111920123728785290)
about
["virtual columns"](https://blog.saeloun.com/2022/01/25/rails-7-postgres-support-for-generated-columns/)
in Ruby on Rails.  These are columns that are computed by the database, based on
a SQL expression.  I tried creating one, using Rails `7.1.3`, but I keep getting
an error in my migration:

```ruby
change_table :users do |t|
  t.virtual :name_upper, type: :string, as: "upper(name)", store: true
end
```

```
Unknown key: :type. Valid keys are: :limit, :precision, :scale, :default, :null, :collation, :comment, :primary_key, :if_exists, :if_not_exists
```

I tried with Sqlite.  I tried with MySQL.  I tried with PostgreSQL.

I tried searching for more info on virtual columns, but found nothing in the
official Rails documentation.  I searched for the error message and didn't find
anything helpful either.

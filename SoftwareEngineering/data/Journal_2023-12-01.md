I found a nice guide to [picking a Java JDK](https://whichjdk.com/) on
[Les Cast Codeurs](http://lescastcodeurs.com/)
[episode 292](https://lescastcodeurs.com/2023/03/20/lcc-292-enterprise-go-beans/).
I have been using OpenJDK that I've been downloading from
[jdk.java.net](https://jdk.java.net/) and installed manually on my MacBook Pro.
They recommend the Eclipse Temurin distribution and to install it with
[SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/).  I already use `sdk` for many things.  Manybe
I'll add `java` to the list...

I stumbled upon
[a one year old Medium article](https://medium.com/@jackskeels/will-management-succeed-at-killing-agile-7126e8d16843)
on agile software development.  The author, Jack Skeels, describes his journey
of discovery of the principles behind the initial agile methodologies and what
he calls
[Humanist Agile](https://medium.com/@jackskeels/the-humanist-agile-manifesto-1f9000d00fd7).
I like how his solution is to massively empower teams by removing management.
It is the complete opposite of Taylor's Scientific Management and
_plan-and-control_ hierarchies.  I would not have believed that it could work if
I had not been exposed to a similar approach at Google, years ago.

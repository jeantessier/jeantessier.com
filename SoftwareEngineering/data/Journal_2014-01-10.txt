I noticed that the CGI scripts on my site are taking forever to execute.  When
I login to the server and run them by hand, they are just fine.  But somehow,
when the are executed through the web, it takes a long time to launch them.  I
only found an obscure reference to PHP4 vs. PHP5 on the Dreamhost pages, but I'm
not even using PHP!  They are just simple CGI scripts written in Perl; 20-year
old technology.

I looked into using [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]]
instead of my own flavor of wiki markup.  I'd have to convert my book and
journal entries, but it would be a more standard syntax that's supported by
somebody else.  But the default processor only converts to what goes inside the
&lt;body&gt; tag.  I'd still have to wrap it with additional markup and figure
out the CSS stylesheet, based on elements that I'd have to reverse engineer from
the generated HTML.  Looks like a lot of work.

Worked on some [[https://www.mongodb.org/][MongoDB]] queries to re-create the
JSON output from =Books_json.cgi=.  So far, I have:

    db.book.aggregate([
        {$unwind: "$reviews"},
        {$lookup: {
            from: "review",
            localField: "reviews",
            foreignField: "_id",
            as: "review"
        }},
        {$unwind: "$review"},
        {$project: {
            _id: false,
            name: true,
            authors: true,
            titles: true,
            publisher: true,
            years: true,
            start: "$review.start",
            stop: "$review.stop",
            body: "$review.body"
        }},
        {$sort: {start: -1}}
    ]);

I also tried this:

    db.book.find({}, {_id: false}).map(function(book) {
        var review = db.review.findOne({_id: {$in: book.reviews}});
        book.start = review.start;
        book.stop = review.stop;
        book.body = review.body;
        return book;
    });

But I have a feeling that it might be inefficient with that inner lookup that
might lead to an "N + 1" problem.  Plus, the output is not neatly filtered the
way I was able to with =$project= in the first example.

Funny exchange on Twitter between two of my favorite software people:

> [**KentBeck**](http://twitter.com/KentBeck)  
> .@[cirillof](http://twitter.com/cirillof) sciosciamento is just such an

Later, @[cirillof](http://twitter.com/cirillof) offered some more explanation.
He is Francesco Cirillo, the originator of the
[Pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).

> &num;sciosciamento is a mood. you're sitting still and let the wind caress you.

The whole thing reminds me of some of the banter between two of my favorite
science-fiction authors: Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov.

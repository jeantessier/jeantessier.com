This [video](https://youtu.be/_sUvKvoK9I8) (in French) talks about geek culture,
Gamergate, and the concept of
[hegemonic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_masculinity).
It posits that video games enabled a class that was left out from the mechanisms
of power to subvert definitions of masculinity to create a new pathway to power
in society.  I found it through
[this episode](https://binge.audio/podcast/les-couilles-sur-la-table/des-ordis-des-souris-et-des-hommes)
of a French feminist podcast that looks at multiple aspects of male identities.

Completely unrelated, I discovered [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), a Node
framework for end-to-end testing.  It drives the browser to exercise an
application the same way a user would.  In this manner, it shares similarities
with [Selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)) and
[Capybara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara_(software)).

Learned about [[https://jwt.io/][JSON Web Tokens]] (JWT, pronounced "jot") while
reading
[[Books.html#Getting%5FMEAN][Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node]].
It is an emerging alternative to SAML, which is a lot more complicated, and an
example of what Sam Newman called a _hash-based messaging code_ (HMAC) in
[[Books.html#Building%5FMicroservices][Building Microservices]].

The server created the JWT and returns it to the client.  A client 
(i.e., browser) can easily decode the payload using JavaScript and return the
JWT to the server as proof of authentication.  If the server has the secret key,
it can validate the signature part of the JWT.  No session management require!

I can see how it would be useful in a microservices architecture, where the
browser gets a JWT from the _authentication_ microservice and passes that JWT to
the other microservices.  Either these other microservices also have the secret
key to validate the JWT, or they can make a secondary call to _authentication_
to validate it.

Python won't let me write "`i++`".  So far, the only explanation I could find
was that Guido didn't like the `++`/`--` operators.  Lame.  For a moment, I
thought I'd be stuck writing super-long "`i = i + 1`" until a friend pointed
out "`i += 1`" worked too.  I guess this will have to do.

There is an FTP module in Python, but it looks pretty useless.  It is little
more than writing explicit commands to a socket and parsing the response
yourself.  I was hoping for a _list_ or _dir_ operation that would return a
directory structure, but I guess I will have to keep on searching.

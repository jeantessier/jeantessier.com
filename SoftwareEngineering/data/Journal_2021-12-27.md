Explored [`rails_event_store`](https://railseventstore.org/) a little more.  It
separates pub/sub features from event streaming features.  Handlers subscribe
to one or more event _types_, or all events.  Publishers can publish events to
a _named stream_, but handlers only care about their types.  It is possible to
replay a stream.  It is also possible to put the same event on multiple streams
at the same time.  This way, you can have a `users` stream of all user events
and at the same time have a `user-1234` stream that is a subset of events
relating only to `User` with ID `1234`.  They even show how to use a handler
to _link_ events to other streams as part of their handling.

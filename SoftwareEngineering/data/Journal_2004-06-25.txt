A friend asked me how I saw myself in the realm of software development.
As I retold my earlier musings about engineering and craftsmanship, he
mentioned that French carmaker [[http://www.renault.fr][Renault]] came
up with a new slogan: "_Cr&eacute;ateur d'Automobiles_", which loosely
translate to "Creator of Cars."  He suggested that I might consider myself a
"creator of tools" or a "software creator."  It suggests a certain part of
innovation and care for one's work.  It does not sound as quaint as "craftsman"
and laypeople would get he gist of it immediately.

It turns out the GitHub webhook I have been using since 2015 was broken all
along.  It gets a signature from GitHub as a request header and compares it to
the `SHA1` of the body of the request and a shared secret.  Both the signature
and the `SHA1` are strings.  I have been using `==` all this time to compare the
two, when I should have been using `eq` instead.  All this time, the script was
not truly verifying the signature and was letting any request through, as long
as it had any signature header.

I only noticed because the site had stopped updating when I pushed commits to
GitHub.  This was because I had renamed the `master` branch to `main`, but I had
not updated the repo on Dreamhost to the new `main` branch.  The webhook was
trying to pull a `master` branch that no longer existed.

GitHub used to show the body of the HTTP response it got from the webhook, but I
don't see them anymore.  The UI only shows an empty box.  When I call the
webhook by hand, I still see a body.  Maybe GitHub is suppressing it, somehow.
I was able to retrieve them using the GitHub CLI, though.

For example:

```bash
gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries/58865076403 | jq -r '.response.payload'
```

I can retrieve multiple deliveries with something to the tune of:

```bash
for delivery_id in $(gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries | jq '.[].id')
do
  echo "==========" $(gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries/$delivery_id | jq -r '.delivered_at') "=========="
  gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries/$delivery_id | jq -r '.response.payload'
done
```

Or, just the most recent.

```bash
for delivery_id in $(gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries | jq '.[0].id')
do
  echo "==========" $(gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries/$delivery_id | jq -r '.delivered_at') "=========="
  gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries/$delivery_id | jq -r '.response.payload'
done
```

Or, fetching the delivery only once, but with payload harder to read.

```bash
for delivery_id in $(gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries | jq '.[0].id')
do
  gh api /repos/jeantessier/jeantessier.com/hooks/6218854/deliveries/$delivery_id | jq '{time:(.delivered_at),reponse:(.response.payload)}'
done
```

As I was working on this, I noticed a new signature header with a `SHA256`.  The
latest documentation only mentions this new `SHA256`.  There is a brief mention
that `SHA1` "is only included for legacy purposes."  Switching to `SHA256` was
easy enough.

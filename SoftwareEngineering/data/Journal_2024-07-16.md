It turns out the GitHub webhook I have been using since 2015 was broken all
along.  It gets a signature from GitHub as a request header and compares it to
the `SHA1` of the body of the request and a shared secret.  Both the signature
and the `SHA1` are strings.  I have been using `==` all this time to compare the
two, when I should have been using `eq` instead.  All this time, the script was
not truly verifying the signature and was letting any request through, as long
as it had any signature header.

I only noticed because the site had stopped updating when I pushed commits to
GitHub.  This was because I had renamed the `master` branch to `main`, but I had
not updated the repo on Dreamhost to the new `main` branch.  The webhook was
trying to pull a `master` branch that no longer existed.

GitHub used to show the body of the HTTP response it got from the webhook, but I
don't see them anymore.  The UI only shows an empty box.  When I call the
webhook by hand, I still see a body.  Maybe GitHub is suppressing it, somehow.

As I was working on this, I noticed a new signature header with a `SHA256`.  I
will have to read the GitHub documentation to see if I need to update my webhook
code.  There may be some new features I'm not benefiting from.

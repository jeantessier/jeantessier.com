Today, I got to replace one of my coworkers with a very small [Python] script.

We are working on two applications that communicate via a
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) message bus.  I am working on one of the
apps and he is working on the other.  My app sends a signal and his app replies
with adjustments based on offline analysis.  In order to test my app, I needed
to simulate his side of the conversation.  So I wrote a small Python script that
listens to RabbitMQ for my signals and returns some canned adjustments on the
message bus.

I have not replaced him definitively; we will need his fully fledged application
with its real data.  But it was a start.  :-)

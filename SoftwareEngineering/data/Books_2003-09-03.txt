Great textbook, with all the really important principles when
designing object-oriented software.  The tone is sometimes a little
too facetious to my taste, but it is an easy read and well worth
it.

The first few sections deal with the core principles of OO, such
as encapsulation and polymorphism and substitutability and so forth.
The style is very lively and concise and to the point, with carefully
selected examples.  Mostly in Java, but the principles apply across
the board.

GitHub now lets us
[create diagrams straight from within Markdown](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/).
They are using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), a JavaScript
library that supports a number of diagrams.  Their UML class and sequence
diagram look a lot like [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/).  They can also track
commits and branches to create "Git graphs".

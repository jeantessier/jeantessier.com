and I stumbled upon =[[https://ngrok.com/][ngrok]]=, a tunneling service that
lets you expose any application on any port on =localhost= to a public address

development machine, expose it on the Internet using =ngrok=, and tell the
service that you're integrating with to call your webhook on the =ngrok=
address.  Boom!  An external service is calling code running on your laptop.

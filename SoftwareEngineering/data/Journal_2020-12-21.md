Kevlin Henney shows how _code_, _data_, and _config_ are all valuable aspects of
a program.  Each one guides how we think about a problem and can lead to
different insights.  It's not that one is always better than the others, but
sometimes it can help to consider a different viewpoint.

The article also references Philippe Krutchen's "4+1" architecture.  I remember
him from the old days of RUP.  That was a blast from the past.

Coraline Ada Ehmke described a
[[http://where.coraline.codes/blog/my-year-at-github/][somewhat toxic environment]]
when she worked at GitHub.  It is not as scathing as Susan Fowler's
[[https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber][experience at Uber]],
but Coraline's manager definitely had it in for her.  According to her, the
manager discounted her later efforts to improve.  And by the time she got put on
the performance improvement plan, it was clear that the manager was just going
through the motions to get her terminated.  It's very sad.  I am so impressed
with GitHub's product, it is disappointing to hear some of the goings on behind
the scene.

Coraline's website had another interesting article on
[[https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-dehumanizing-myth-of-the-meritocracy][meritocracy]]
and its supposed benefits, which may only be a means for the people in power to
remain in power and exclude everyone else.

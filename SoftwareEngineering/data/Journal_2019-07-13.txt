There have been competing threads on Twitter about "10x engineers", the
supposedly superhuman developers who are so much better than _ordinary_ ones.

I don't know if the author was being sarcastic or if they really believes what
they said.  What I do know is that there are people out there who agree with
their toxic description of 10x engineers.  The author lists a bunch of traits of
assholes who can't be bothered to work with other people.  I wouldn't want to
be anywhere near the people they describe.

[[https://twitter.com/jaymaymo/status/1149893214037368837][Another thread]] is
much more in line with what I want to see in my fellow software engineers.  The
desired traits are all about collaborating with others and uplifting everyone.
That is what I aspire to be.  Now, I try to be helpful and compassionate, but
you also need an environment where such attitudes are welcomed and supported.
If everyone has large egos and cannot afford to look weak, it will be very
difficult to build a team spirit where everyone helps each other.

was also very positive, but focused more on how 10x engineers have a lot of
knowledge and experience from read the docs and learning all they can about the
tools they are using.

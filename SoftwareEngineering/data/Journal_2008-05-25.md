I looked for some corresponding features between [jMock](http://jmock.org)
and [EasyMock](http://easymock.org).

| Feature                           | jMock                            | EasyMock                               |
|:----------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| Default return value              | `one (myMock).getFoo()`          | _n/a_                                  |
| Ignoring a method                 | `ignoring (myMock).someMethod()` | `expect(myMock.someMethod()).asStub()` |
| Intercept mocked method           | `Action` and `CustomAction`      | `IAnswer<T>`                           |
| Access arguments to mocked method | `invocation.parameterValues`     | `EasyMock.getCurrentArguments()`       |

It looks like everything I can do with jMock, I can do with EasyMock too.
All, that is, except returning innocuous values automatically.  I'll need to
look into the `andStub...()` methods further.

Reading up on [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) as a replacement for the
[Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework.  Some people say Fastify is a more
modern web application framework that makes use of the latest JavaScript
language additions.  I also found a nice
[cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/fastify).

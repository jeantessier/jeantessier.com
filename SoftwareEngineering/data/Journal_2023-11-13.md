An interesting [exerpt from this interview of Bob Woodward by Ari Melber](https://youtu.be/E18UmgEvGJk?si=59sit-8_vNdrZYz8&t=4498)
talks about the importance of humility in recognizing the limits of your own
knowledge.  You may be an expert on one topic, but that does not automatically
give you invaluable insights into some other topic.  You have to recognize that
there is a body of knowledge that you may not be aware of, and that you will
need to seek out people with expertise in that domain in order to refine your
opinion.

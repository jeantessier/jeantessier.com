As I was doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/), I kept my copy
of The Pickaxe open next to me.  I was using Ruby `3.2.2` and this is the most
recent edition of The Pickaxe.  It made for a great reference book for the
various classes and methods I was using, like `Array` and `Enumerable` and
`Hash`.  The reference section goes through all the main classes and all their
methods in a very consistent format that's easy to grok.  I could complement
with checks to `ri` for the official Ruby documentation for the latest features
in Ruby `3.x`.

I read an article that recommended using the
[[https://standardjs.com/][JavaScript Standard Style]].  It's just a name, there
is no wildly accepted standard for JavaScript.  But it comes with a tool that
verifies compliance for you, which I thought was interesting.  So, I installed
it and tried it out on my JavaScript samples.  I like omitting semicolons and
using the ES6 arrow functions.  I don't like using single quotes or two-space
indents.

At first, I put =/%2A global angular %2A/= at the top of each file, to suppress
the angular-not-defined messages.  Then, I switched to calling
=standard --global angular= instead.  I still had to use a specially formatted
comment to suppress errors around the
[[https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown][Showdown]] library, though.

In the end, the Angular apps (Books, Journal, etc.) started complaining with the
_standardized_ JavaScript code, so I reverted it.

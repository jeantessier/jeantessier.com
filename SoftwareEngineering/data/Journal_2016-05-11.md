Getting more familiar with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/).  I worked on
the schema for my sample Book Review app.  I kept the entities in separate
collections and used manual references to tie them together.  I could have used
embedded sub-documents, but I wanted to experiment with resolving references
anyway.

There is a lot of
[decent documentation for MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/reference/).
I still had to do a lot of trial and error to get the queries right.  And I
still need to work on creating the right indices.

Joined Mastodon as part of the great Twitter exodus.  I was prompted by a Martin
Fowler article where [he described his own journey to Mastodon]().  I found two
servers that aligned with my main interests:
[techhub](https://techhub.social/about) and [sfba](https://sfba.social/about).
I'm going to hang out mostly on Techhub for the moment, looking for interesting
tech people to follow.

It's interesting that these Mastodon servers are written in Ruby on Rails.  I
found a thriving Ruby community on Mastodon.  The UI is a little dated, though.
I miss the slick experience on Twitter.

I started looking into the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming
language, out of curiosity.  It wants to do some interesting things with pattern
matching as a primary element of programming.

It brings back memories of the
[Miranda](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/) language I used
to learn functional programming back in college.  In Miranda, you could write
variations of functions that explicitly matched on patterns in the parameters.

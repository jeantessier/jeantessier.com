I was listening to the
[[http://ryanripley.com/agile-for-humans/][Agile for Humans]] podcast and I came
upon a great episode:

    * [[http://ryanripley.com/hr-insights-with-esther-derby-and-stacy-johnston/][HR Insights with Esther Derby and Stacy Johnston]]

In it, they discuss the role of managers in a post-factory work setting.  They
talk the importance of trust in the workplace culture, both between the manager
and the employee, and between the team members themselves.  This reminds me of
my earlier thoughts on [[2016-02-26]] about _psychological safety_.

Excerpt:

<blockquote>

*Ryan Ripley*: We hire somebody.  We onboard them.  They might get a few days of
training around corporate history and culture, if they're lucky.  Then, they're
thrown into the fire of "Here, now you need to be productive."  And we may or
may not define that for them.  And then, at the end of the year, we'll ask them
how they think they did, and them we'll sit them down and give them the right
answer.

*Ester Derby*: Oh!  That just sounds painful when you describe it that way.

Happened to me more than once.  It rarely ended well.

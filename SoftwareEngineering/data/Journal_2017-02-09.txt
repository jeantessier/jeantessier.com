I was listening to the
[[http://ryanripley.com/agile-for-humans/][Agile for Humans]] podcast and I came
upon a great episode:

    * [[http://ryanripley.com/hr-insights-with-esther-derby-and-stacy-johnston/][HR Insights with Esther Derby and Stacy Johnston]]

In it, they discuss the role of managers in a post-factory work setting.  They
talk the importance of trust in the workplace culture, both between the manager
and the employee, and between the team members themselves.  This reminds me of
my earlier thoughts on [[2016-02-26]] about _psychological safety_.

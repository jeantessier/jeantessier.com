Spent the day at the [[http://apimixtape.com/][API Mixtape conference]].  It was
a first-time conference on people building web APIs to connect services.  There
were speakers from:

    * [[https://slack.com/][Slack]]
    * [[https://about.gitlab.com/][GitLab]]
    * Facebook's [[http://graphql.org/][GraphQL]]
    * [[https://keen.io/][Keen IO]]
    * Lyft's move from a monolith to microservices

The conference was organized by [[https://readme.io/][ReadMe]], a company whose
tools help you document APIs and manage that documentation.  They did a live
demo of their =[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/api][api]]= open source API
runner that was pretty cool.  It versioned the API and automatically documented
everything, including code snippets to call endpoints.

My biggest takeaway from the conference was the importance of customer feedback
in the early stages, when you're defining the API.  It will inform your vision
and make sure you're building something that people will want to use and find
useful.  You must not get stuck in your own head.

Also, I read a great Harvard Business Review article on
[[https://hbr.org/2017/05/the-biggest-mistakes-new-executives-make][mistakes by new executives]]
(and many leadership positions too).  I have struggled with people who come into
a team and don't have the humility to listen first.  They are so convinced that
they know better that they completely dismiss the institutional knowledge.  This
is condescending to their new underlings.  How could they possibly know better
when they are coming from the outside, when they have no clue to what their
people know or how they've been operating?  Unless the organization is a
complete disaster, they've been doing _some_ things right.  Right?

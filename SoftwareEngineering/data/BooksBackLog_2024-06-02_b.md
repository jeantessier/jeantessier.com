I have a couple of books on writing that I enjoy very much.  _BUGS in Writing_
by Lyn Dupr&eacute; and _Right, Wrong, and Risky_ by Mark Davidson are two
writing guides I've enjoyed a lot.  This one seems focused on writings of a
technical nature, for a technical audience.  With special attention to writing
blog posts.

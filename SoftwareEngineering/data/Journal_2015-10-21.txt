Found a really interesting article where Richard Feynman talks about
[[http://fabiusmaximus.com/2009/02/12/feynman/][integrity in scientific discourse]].
He emphasizes the importance of "bending over backwards to show how youâ€™re maybe
wrong."  While this kind of integrity is par for the course when I talk to
fellow technologists, I find that it doesn't work quite as well with non-STEM
people.  And don't get me started on demanding it from others: challenging their
glib statements is tantamount to calling them liars.

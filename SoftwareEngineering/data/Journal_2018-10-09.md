I have been trying to wrap my head around [React](https://reactjs.org/) for
the longest time.  Somehow, it always rebuffs my attempts at understanding what
I'm looking at.  But I finally found a
[really great explanation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
that walks me through all the concepts in a way that I can grok them.  I'm still
missing some of the setup to allow me to play with it on my own, but at least I
can read it now.

Refresher look at the [[http://hadoop.apache.org/][Hadoop project]].  I see a
number of sub-projects that look a lot like the parts of Google's MapReduce
stack.

<center><table>
<tr><th>Hadoop</th><th width="33%"></th><th>Google</th></tr>
<tr><td>HBase</td><td align="center">%3D&gt;</td><td>Bigtable</td></tr>
<tr><td>HDFS</td><td align="center">%3D&gt;</td><td>GFS</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hive</td><td align="center">%3D&gt;</td><td>???</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pig</td><td align="center">%3D&gt;</td><td>Sawzall</td></tr>
</table></center>

When I saw the brief description of [[http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/][Pig]] on
the Hadoop home page, I immediately thought of Google's
[[http://labs.google.com/papers/sawzall.html][Sawzall]] language which you can
describe as scripting for MapReduce.  Sawzall is extremely powerfull.  You can
express fairly involved analysis logic in very few lines of code.  I was hoping
for something as powerful in Pig, but the sample code seems a lot more verbose
(and obtuse) than Sawzall.

Also, Hive reminded me of Google's cluster for running Sawzall scripts on log
data.  But Hive looks to be applicable beyond just log processing.

I was pleased to see that Hadoop claims great support for the Amazon EC2 and S3
stack.  That could come in handy if we ever start to use it at ShopWell.

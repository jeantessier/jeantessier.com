Found a very interesting article by Paul Grapham on
[[http://paulgraham.com/genius.html][a theory of genius]].  He reflects on how
the distributions of talent and the distribution of genius do not match.  He
then submits a hypothesis as to why that is.  "People who've done great work",
that exhibit genius, also have "an obsessive interest in a particular topic."
Now, many people have obsessive interests in particular topics, but not all of
them are geniuses.

My key takeaways:

    1 You cannot tell ahead of time which paths are promising and which ones aren't.
    1 The odds that an obsessive interest in a particular topic will lead to a breakthrough are pretty low.
    1 "It's more promising if you're creating something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates."

For Paul Graham, "working to understand the natural world counts as creating
rather than consuming."  So, Darwin and Newton were on the right track.

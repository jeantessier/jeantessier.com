A friend of mine recommended I read [Radial Candor](http://a.co/65Lo0qh) by
Kim Scott.  I'm not sure if there's isn't a hidden message in this
recommendation.  The premise seems interesting: have the courage to give
criticism, as long as it's about things that you care about.

I also found a
[BuzzFeed article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonnyensall/this-is-radical-candor?utm_term=.xhaBpxN2B#.tbwb46Mqb)
on the approach where the reporter observed it in a software company in London,
and also talked to a sociologist about the merits of "too much candor".  They
were not as optimistic, since people do need their privacy and basic diplomacy
still helps lubricate communication.  The sessions described in the article
where participants share criticism they have received seemed pretty narcissistic
and self-centered.  I think we must be careful not to burden others with our own
failings (or overly subjective opinions).  If **I** have a problem with something,
it could be unfair of me to dump it on someone else, especially if there is
nothing they can do about it.

I might have to read the book to figure it out for myself.  It seems pretty
short, so it wouldn't take too long.  But I'm already fearing that it will be
lightweight and anecdotal, like
[_Rework_](Books.html#Rework) and
[_Remote_](Books.html#Remote_Office_Not_Required), which I've read
recently.

Yesterday, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) announced they will be
[terminating their free offerings](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter) this
coming November.  I have a
[small experiment](https://afternoon-cliffs-9951.herokuapp.com/Books.html)
running there for free since 2016 as an exercise of the MEAN stack.  I can
either take it down or move to the Hobby paid tier at $7 per month.  It might be
worth it while I'm actively working on something, but not for the multi-month
lulls in between bouts of activity.

Heroku is a fun platform, and I'd hate to become completely disconnected from
it.  I like how deployments on Heroku are just a `git push` command, and you see
all the deployment logs right there as the command executes.

If I remove my small experiment, my account will be at risk of becoming inactive
and being deleted.  If I want to keep it, I'll cost $84 per year.  I might not
mind giving this much money to a small, independent PaaS provider.  But Heroku
is now part of Salesforce, and I don't feel particularly generous towards
Salesforce.

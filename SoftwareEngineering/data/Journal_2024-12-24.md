I finished this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).
I was better able to manage my pace, pausing difficult problems instead of
burning out on them, and I was able to do both puzzles for each day, though not
always on that day.  All my code is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jeantessier/advent-of-code-2024).
I did every challenge in Ruby, and I even re-did
[day10](https://github.com/jeantessier/advent-of-code-2024/tree/main/day10) in
JavaScript, just for fun.

The [Bitnami Kafka](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kafka) image I was using is
no longer available for free.  I found out when some of the continuous
integration builds for my Book Review project started failing.  I will have to
find a replacement, one that is as easy to set up and use as the Bitnami image.

[This blog post](https://hyperbo.la/w/nemawashi/) talks about _nemawashi_, a
Japanese term about consensus building.  The Ruby community sure loves using 
Japanese terms for its cultural constructs: _omakase_, etc.

Someone brought up Jim Wierich, his
[Grand Unified Theory of Software Design](https://vimeo.com/10837903), and his
ideas about coupling & [connascence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connascence):
knowledge that one part of the system has about another part of the system.

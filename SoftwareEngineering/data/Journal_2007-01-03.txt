Got Python for my PCs from [[http://python.org/][python.org]].

I found some good candidates for books on Python:

    * [[http://amzn.com/0596100469][Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0596002815][Learning Python]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0596009259][Programming Python]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0596007973][Python Cookbook]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0672328623][Python Essential Reference, 3rd Edition]]

Obviously, they modeled _Learning Python_ and _Programming Python_ on the very
popular titles for Perl.  But whereas _Programming Python_ is much more popular
than _Learning Perl_, it appears to be the reverse with Python and
_Learning Python_ gets more stars on Amazon than _Programming Python_.  Curious.

There is also a pretty cool
[[http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html][online tutorial]].

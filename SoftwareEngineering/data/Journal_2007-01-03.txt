Got Python for my PCs from [[http://python.org/][python.org]].

I found some good candidates for books on Python:

    * [[http://amzn.com/0596100469][Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0596002815][Learning Python]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0596009259][Programming Python]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0596007973][Python Cookbook]]
    * [[http://amzn.com/0672328623][Python Essential Reference, 3rd Edition]]

Obviously, they modelled "Learning Python" and "Programming Python" on the very
popular titles for Perl.  But wheras "Programming Python" is much more popular
than "Learning Perl", it appears to be the reverse with Python and "Learning
Python" gets more stars on Amazon than "Programming Python".  Curious.

There is also a pretty cool
[[http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html][online tutorial]].

[combines DDD and event-driven design](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/did-domain-driven-design-help-me-to-ease-out-the-approach-towards-event-driven-architecture-b52e770ebcc).
DDD helps tease out the nouns in the domain, and events help tease out the verbs
in the domain.  Together, they can help identify boundaries in the domain.  The
author highly recommends event storming, where stakeholders come together and
roleplay the system.

[provides isolation in Rails applications](https://medium.com/airtribe/enforcing-modularity-inside-a-rails-monolith-f856adb54e1d)
using Rails engines.  At work, we've been tring to break down a Rails monolith
with engines, but the friction they add to the development process is proving to
be too much.  I've been reading
[_Component-Based Rails Applications_](Books.html#Component_Based_Rails_Applications)
where the author advocates a lighter approach using unpacked gems, with less
complexity but still quite a bit of friction.  Lately, we've been looking at
using Shopify's [Packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk) as a cheap way
to group chunks of code together and at the very least track the boundary
transgressions.  It is very low friction, and we can set future objectives
around dealing with the transgressions progressively.

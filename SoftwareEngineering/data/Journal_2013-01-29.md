I was listening to French programming podcast
[Les Cast Codeurs](http://lescastcodeurs.com/) 
[episode 68](http://lescastcodeurs.com/2012/11/29/les-cast-codeurs-podcast-episode-68-devoxx-2012-et-les-putchettes/)
about [Devoxx 2012](http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home).  They asked
attendees about their favorite session and a majority of them mentioned the
session on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).  It was led by my good buddy
[Mi&#353;ko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/) and his AngularJS co-conspirator
Igor Minar.  I am very happy for their success with AngularJS.  I'm more geared
towards jQuery at the moment, but AngularJS looks like a very nice JavaScript
framework too.

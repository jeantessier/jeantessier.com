I stumbled upon
[[https://medium.com/@jackskeels/will-management-succeed-at-killing-agile-7126e8d16843][a one year old Medium article]]
on agile software development.  The author, Jack Skeels, describes his journey
of discovery of the principles behind the initial agile methodologies and what
he calls
[[https://medium.com/@jackskeels/the-humanist-agile-manifesto-1f9000d00fd7][Humanist Agile]].
I like how his solution is to massively empower teams by removing management.
It is the complete opposite of Taylor's Scientific Management and
_plan-and-control_ hierarchies.  I would not believe that it could work if I had
not lived it at Google, years ago.

New Year resolution: learn Python.  We use a lot of Python at work to write
scripts and small applications.  Learning it will make me more efficient.  If I
write my own scripts in Python, someone else is more likely to be able to
maintain them than if they were written in Perl.

So I am quitting Perl cold-turkey.  From now on, I will use only Python for
scripting (besides Bash scripts).  Quitting Perl will force me to go through
the effort of finding what I need from Python rather than falling back on Perl
out of expediency.  So far, I have not found an equivalent to `perl -p/-n` to
quickly process a file.  :-(

I borrowed some books from a colleague until I can get my own (his are a little
out of date):

- [Python Essential Reference](http://amzn.com/0735710910)

I came upon [[https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown][Showdown]], a way to
render [[http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/][Markdown]] as JavaScript
embedded in an HTML page.  I wrote
[[AngularShowdownTest/index.html][a tiny test page]] using
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]] to try writing markdown text in a
=&lt;textarea&gt;=, convert it to HTML using Showdown, and use the generated
HTML to populate a =&lt;div&gt;=.

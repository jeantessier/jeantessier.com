The next step in the great Twitter exodus might be
[Threads](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/introducing-threads-new-app-text-sharing/)
from Meta.  I created my account and it prompted be to start following the
people I already followed on Instagram.  I'm not very active on Instagram.  I
was taken by surprise that following requires the other party to accept.  I've
been on Twitter and Mastodon for too long, I guess.

The UI is more aesthetically pleasing than Mastodon.  At launch, there are no
direct messages.  I can access Twitter and Mastodon from my laptop as well as my
phone, but Threads looks to be app-only.  Just like Instagram, I guess.

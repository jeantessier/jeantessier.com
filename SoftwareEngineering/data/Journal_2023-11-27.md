I stumbled on this toot on Mastodon about
[computing the expected reading time](https://techhub.social/@ethauvin@mastodon.social/111476823867158000)
for an article.  I always thought these markers were computed from monitoring
how long some "average" reader would take to read the article through.  Little
did I know that it is much, much simpler.  Simply divide the number of words in
the article by some arbitrary, "average" reading speed.  With a few tweaks.  It
is based on
[Medium's read time calculation](https://techhub.social/@ethauvin@mastodon.social/111476823867158000).

I went ahead and implemented the same approach on my blog and reading lists.  I
didn't bother with the tweaks, because they relate to how long it takes people
to "read" images.  I use images so seldom that it wouldn't make a significant
difference.  I don't show reading times of one minute or less because these
articles are short enough to fit in a single view.

The reading lists are a React app and I was able to put the reading time logic
in its own component.  My blog is an AngularJS (Angular 1.0) app, and there I
mixed the reading time logic with the rest of the code.  I'm not very happy with
this lack of separation, but I'm not going to invest much on improving an
obsolete AngularJS app.

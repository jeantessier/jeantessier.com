I attended this month's meeting of the [[http://www.jera.com/bayxp/][BayXP]].
[[http://xprogramming.com/][Ron Jeffries]] was talking about some of
the things that are on his mind lately.

First, let's talk about the speaker.  He reminded me very strongly of a
former coworker who acted as a mentor to me when I entered the workforce.  It
was a little uncanny.

The talk was lively as he led us through some of his latest thoughts on the
subject of planning.  Through his teaching exercises, he has had some insights
into the dynamics of planning.  Students with no real knowledge of the tasks'
value or difficulty can still generate pretty good schedules.  Even random
schedules can still work out pretty good.  So how can we apply this knowledge
to real projects?  No definitive answers yet, but some interesting questions.
More to come later, I guess.

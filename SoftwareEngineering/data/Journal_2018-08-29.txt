I watched a great [[https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw][talk on microservices]] by
Randy Shoup of Stitch Fix (at the time).  The talk was recorded back in 2017,
but I only found it today.

Some highlights:

    * eBay's monolith: [[https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=16m38s][now that's a monolith]].
    * [[https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=20m33s][Isolated persistence]].
    * [[https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=23m2s][Events as first-class constructs]].
    * [[https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=32m6s][Single system of record with ]], every other copy is a read-only, non-authoritative cache.
    * [[https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=37m52s][Materialize the View]] instead of using =join=.
    * [[https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=41m44s][Workflows and sagas]], just like financial systems.

At Directly, we've had events as first-class constructs since 2011-02-02.  We
worked hard on isolating persistence and managing read-only cache copies when we
extracted our first microservice, back in September 2016.

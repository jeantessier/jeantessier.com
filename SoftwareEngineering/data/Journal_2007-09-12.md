Borrowed a FireWire cable so I can copy data out of my Alienware onto my
MacBook Pro.  I needed MacDrive so Windows could write to the MacOS-formatted
drive.  It works pretty well, but it was slow work copying everything.  And I
ran out of space on my MacBook Pro; I only got to copy 75GB and I still have
another 50GB to go.

A new edition of the [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) 
[Technology Radar](https://assets.thoughtworks.com/assets/technology-radar-vol-16-en.pdf)
is out.  It is still very favorable to [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and
much less so for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), though still curious
about [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).

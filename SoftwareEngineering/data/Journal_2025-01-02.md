Continuing the tutorial on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and Git.
This
[post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-github-actions-to-deploy-serverless-applications/)
on the AWS blog is walking me through the steps.  I did this
[SAM tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started-hello-world.html)
to setup a SAM project.  I tried to setup permissions manually, but I got stuck
in IAM Identity Center.  Running `sam configure sso` took care of things and
created a profile.  Now, I can pass `--profile` to every SAM command that needs
to talk to the cloud.  With it, I was able to run `sam deploy` and deploy the
tutorial code into the cloud.  I don't see it on my AWS console, but it's out
there, somewhere, running happily along.

The next step will be to use GitHub Actions to deploy automatically when I push
to GitHub.

This tutorial "Hello World" function is in Python.  I'll want to do a Node one,
next.

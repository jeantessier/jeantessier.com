I found a cool plugin for the [[https://atom.io/][Atom]] editor that lets people
share a session for [[https://atom.io/packages/atom-pair][pair programming]].
You can invite others to join the session using [[https://slack.com/][Slack]].
At work, we have collaborators that live in Europe and this could help us pair
program.  Or even pairing with my office coworkers when one of us is working
from home.

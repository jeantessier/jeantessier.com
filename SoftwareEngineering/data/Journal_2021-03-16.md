Dan North is mounting an assault on SOLID.  He wrote an interesting article
where he [criticizes SOLID](https://dannorth.net/2021/03/16/cupid-the-back-story/),
goes back to the root problem that each principle addresses, and suggests
different, less dogmatic ways to deal with these root problems.

Lately, it's become fashionable to argue against Unble Bob and many of his
teachings.  I don't care for his politics and I always thought his creed needed
a pinch of salt.  So, I'm curious what alternatives people are bringing up and
what else I can learn from them.

I was looking for a good book to learn
[[https://www.djangoproject.com/][Django]] and this one was at the top of the
lists.  Now, Django is now at version 2.0.6 but the book is about version 1.11.
I hope the differences will not be to hard to manage.

<blockquote>

This book is not a tutorial.  If you are new to Django, this book will be
helpful but large parts will be challenging for you.

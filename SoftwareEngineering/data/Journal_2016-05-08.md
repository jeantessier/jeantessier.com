Here's a crazy idea: I could use microservices to implement the backend for my
sample Book Review app.  This might reduce the number of combinations I'd have
to work with.  I'd need one microservice for users, one for books, and one for
reviews.  Each could be in a different backend technology: Grails, Rails, Node.
The microservice for users could handle authentication using JWTs.  Either all
microservices could share the secret to verify the JWTs, or they could call to
the microservice for users to validate them.

I could use Sam Newman's
[Backends For Frontends](http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/)
pattern to further reduce the number of combinations.  Different frontends could
talk to slim BFFs that talk to the set of microservices.

I could use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to manage deployment, as well as
learning how to _dockerize_ these technologies.  Not sure if I should run all
the images on the same virtual machine, and deal with port management, or set
each one on its own virtual machine and avoid port collisions.  Grails defaults
to port 8080, `npm` to port 5000, and Node and Rails both default to port 3000.

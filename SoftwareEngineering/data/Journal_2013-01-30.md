A tweet by Kent Beck pointed me to this blog entry by Steve Yegge about
[coding style](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html)

[loose vs. strong typing](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/02/portrait-of-n00b.html).
It mentions how novice programmers try to specify everything to the utmost

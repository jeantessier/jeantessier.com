While I was researching [[http://redis.io/][Redis]], I stumbled upon a Grails 3
plugin to do JWT:

    * =[[https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/spring-security-rest][spring-security-rest]]=
    * =spring-security-rest= [[http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/latest/docs/][documentation]]
    * =[[https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/spring-security-rest-redis][spring-security-rest-redis]]= for Redis backing
    * general =[[https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/redis][redis]]= plugin

I was able to start a Redis instance using [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]]
but I had to make sure it exposed the right port.

    $ docker run --name some-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis

I had to compile a local copy of Redis to get =redis-cli=, but after that it had
no problem connecting to the instance in the container.

I also came across an interesting
[[http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2016/09/08/explaining-agile/][article on agile organizations]]
where the author argues against the hierarchical, top-down nature of traditional
organizations, what he calls _20<sup>th</sup> century organizations_.  As he
walks down the history of the Agile movement, he shows how early efforts focused
on small teams and more recent efforts have been focusing on providing value to
the customer.  Now, we're coming to realize the impact of de-centralized
networks, where collaboration is more powerful than top-down delegation.

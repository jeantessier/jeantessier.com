While I was researching [[http://redis.io/][Redis]], I stumbled upon a Grails 3
plugin to do JWT:

    * =[[https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/spring-security-rest][grails-spring-security]]=
        * =[[http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/latest/docs/][documentation]]=
        * =[[https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/spring-security-rest-redis][Redis backing]]=
    * =[[https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/redis][redis]]=

I was able to start a Redis instance using [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]]
but I had to make sure it exposed the right port.

    $ docker run --name some-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis

I had to compile a local copy of Redis to get =redis-cli=, but after that it had
no problem connecting to the instance in the container.

Had a discussion at work about how comments lie and you shouldn't rely on
them too much.  Of course, eXtreme Programming advocates actually recommend you
don't even bother with comments.  My coworkers don't agree.  And they wish all
this _nonsense_ would just end.

In my opinion, comments rely on human nature to stay current, which is
highly unreliable.  Eventually, as the team grows and the complexity increases
and the release pressure builds, the effort required to maintain the comments
exceeds their ROI.  It is in the fundamental nature of comments to lie, no
matter how hard you fight it.  In the end, entropy will win.

My colleagues' counter-argument is that you don't really come upon such bad,
_lying_ comments all that often.  And it is already hard enough to get
programmers to write comments, we don't need to discourage them further.  One
could say that yes, it is hard, and they should be spending their energy
writing code instead.

This discussion is far from over.

Each time a new version of [Grails](http://grails.org/) has been coming out,
I would go through my projects and create an empty Grails application at the
project's current version and another empty application at Grails latest
version.  I would then compare both empty applications and apply the differences
to my project to "upgrade" it to the latest Grails version.  It is a little
labor intensive.

I've now found the
[Grails Profiles Versions](https://github.com/grails-profiles-versions) GitHub
account that does it all for me.  It has separate projects for each Grails
profile, like
[`rest-api`](https://github.com/grails-profiles-versions/rest-api-versions) or
[`web`](https://github.com/grails-profiles-versions/web-versions).  Just
plug in the versions to compare as tags, and off you go.  All in the beautiful
GitHub UI.  It's like magic!

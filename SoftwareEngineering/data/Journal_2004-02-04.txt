For some time, I've been saying that if you can't communicate your ideas to
others successfully, it is just as if you hadn't had them in the first place.
What I mean by this is that the onus is on *you* to get the stuff out of
your head and it is your responsability to get the message across to your
audience.  Not everybody agrees with me, but that's what I say anyway.

Now, don't you just hate it when you come to some great conclusion after a
long and thorough reflexion, only to find out that someone from the Antiquities
beat you to it by thousands of years?  Today I came upon this quote attributed
to Thucydides, allegedly over 2,300 years ago:

<blockquote>

A man who has the knowledge but lacks the power to express it is no better off
than if he never had any ideas at all.

</blockquote>

A little more research showed that Thucydides was a historian.  The quote is
part of a speech by Pericles to the Athenian assembly, shortly before he died
in 429 B.C.

I found the quote in

It is now at the top of my list of favorite quotes.

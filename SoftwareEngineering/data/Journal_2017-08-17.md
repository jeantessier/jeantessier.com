I learned about [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), a code
formatter for JavaScript that is a little less opinionated than
[JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).  It has a really nice
integration with the Atom editor.  And it lets me fine tune some of the rules
(that's what I mean by _less opinionated_).  It won't automatically convert your
callbacks to ES6 arrow functions, though.

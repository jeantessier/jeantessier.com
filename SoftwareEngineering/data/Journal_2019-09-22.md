I managed to fix my
[`micronaut-data`](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data)
sample application.  First, I need to specify that it is a Groovy application.
The documentation mentions a dependency in `build.gradle` that looks like:

    annotationProcessor "io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-processor:1.0.0.M1"

But this dependency is for Java applications.  It is immediately followed by an
information box that talks about how this dependency needs to be rewritten in
Kotlin or Groovy  applications.  I had skipped the information box upon first
reading.  Once I changed the dependency to the Groovy-friendly:

    compileOnly "io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-processor:1.0.0.M1"

Everything fell into place and now the application works just fine.

InfoQ has a series of articles on
[cell-based architecture](https://www.infoq.com/articles/cell-based-architecture-2024-series/).
We went from a monolith to microservices.  Now, the pendulum is swinging back
and people are "re-discovering" cells.  A cell is a self-contained subset of
services that are used to partition traffic.  It picks up elements from service
mesh, too.  A _control plane_ helps to manage the cell, while a _data plane_
routes data between cells.  The authors recommend minimizing data transfers
between cells to preserve isolation.  If one cell fails, the failure is limited
to a subset of users.

I tried [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) to summarize the InfoQ articles.  I also
connected my LangChain examples to Claude.

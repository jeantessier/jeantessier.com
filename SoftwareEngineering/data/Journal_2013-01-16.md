Today, I was explaining stand-up meetings to a non-technical team member.  I
remember learning about this practice while reading about eXtreme Programming.
It was also popularized by Scrum, but I couldn't recall if one or the other was
the originator.  The
[Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) didn't say
where stand-up meetings came from, but an
[entry on freakonomics](http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/02/03/all-hail-the-stand-up-meeting/)
quoted someone who quoted someone who claimed they went as far back as World
War I.  (For more on third-degree quotes, see _The Name of the Rose_ by Umberto
Eco.)

The original quote is by Allen C. Bluedorn, a college professor at the
University of Missouri, from a 1999 paper titled "The Effects of Stand-Up and
Sit-Down Meeting Formats on Meeting Outcomes".  The one book I could find by him is
[The Human Organization of Time](../Books.html#The_Human_Organization_of_Time).
The description promises a discussion of the nature of Time and how we perceive
it.  Seems very interesting.

I was reading the [[https://www.thoughtworks.com/][ThoughtWorks]] 
[[https://assets.thoughtworks.com/assets/technology-radar-nov-2016-en.pdf][Technology Radar]]
where they were signing the praise of [[http://emberjs.com/][Ember.js]].  So I
made my way through their quickstart tutorial.

Incidentally, the technology radar also said to keep away from
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]].

A members-only article on Medium is
[advocating against using ISO 8601 dates](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/why-developers-should-stop-using-iso-8601-for-date-time-e6ee5fc8ad87).
Their argument is that [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) is too
broad and it is hard to build a parser that would be fully compliant.  They
recommend using
[RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) instead, which is
limited to the most popular format from ISO 8601, namely _yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss_.
Strictly speaking, ISO 8601 requires a _T_ between date and time, but RFC 3339
allows a space instead.  I find it more readable with a space.

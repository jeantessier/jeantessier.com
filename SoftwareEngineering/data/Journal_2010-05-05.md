Today, at [ShopWell](http://shopwell.com/), we released the code from our
latest sprint.  This release is very personal to me because of the new
ingredient highlighting feature.

A few sprints ago, we built the grade explanation feature that shows some of
the good and not-so-good things about each product.  At the time, I came up with
the idea to highlight the elements of the page that relate to these judgments.
I pitched it to the product manager, discussed it with the graphic designer and
front-end developer, but there was no room in the schedule at the time.  Until
now.  We collaborated really well to make it happen.  The graphic designer,
[@k4rl](http://twitter.com/k4rl), made it look so much better than what I had
pictured in my mind.  The front-end developer
[@mepetestuart](http://twitter.com/mepetestuart), used his JavaScript magic
to make it super dynamic.  I coded all the back-end work to figure out what
needed to be highlighted and whether it was good or bad.  It all came together
beautifully and I hope you enjoy it too.

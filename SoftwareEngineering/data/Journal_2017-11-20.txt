I found
[[https://www.djamware.com/post/5a10b5f580aca75eadc12d6c/grails-3-angular-5-profile-crud-web-application-example][an example]]
that combines a server written in Grails 3.3.1 and auto-generated REST
scaffolding that is then used by an Angular 5 app.  The example only builds
simple screens to list, create, show, edit, and delete a single type of entity,
but the work is pretty trivial.

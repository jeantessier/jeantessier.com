I'm thinking of building a sample application on a number of technology stacks
in order to experience what it's like to develop on those stacks.  By building
the same app in different environments, I might better see what their strengths
and weaknesses are.

I'm thinking of using my current [[Books.html][book review]] for this.  Reviews
has a somewhat simple schema and I can add users for access control and to tie
persistent entities together.

One the backend:

    * Node + Express
    * Grails
    * Spring Root
    * Ruby on Rails

Producing a number of outputs:

    * HTML from templates (Jade, GSP, JSP)
    * REST API

From a number of data sources:

    * MongoDB
    * MySQL

With different frontends:

    * HTML
    * AngularJS
    * React + ?

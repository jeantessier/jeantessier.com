I'm thinking of building a sample application on a number of technology stacks:

    * Node + Express
    * Grails
    * Spring Root
    * Ruby on Rails

Producing a number of outputs:

    * HTML from templates (Jade, GSP, JSP)
    * REST API

From a number of data sources:

    * MongoDB
    * MySQL

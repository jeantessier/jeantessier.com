<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i realize now that being a manager of people at a company means existing at the intersection of humanity and capitalism</p>&mdash; Vaidehi Joshi (@vaidehijoshi) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi/status/1390080613223260163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The people who report to you need your humanity.  They want to be treated like
human beings, each with their individual quirks and aspirations.  The company's
management wants you to treat your reports like resources, based on arbitrary
criteria that are meant to serve the company, irrespective of the individual.

Copied all remaining data to the external drive.  Ran Alienware Respawn to
ghost the machine, but it failed.  When I reboot, I get a blue screen to flash
for one moment and then it tries to reboot again.  I guess the crash actually
damaged the drive and some sectors are now bad.  The Respawn tried to restore
these sectors to what they had been but failed.  It looks like I will have to
reinstall Windows again and figure out all the drivers.  One good thing: just
before running Respawn, I got the sound card to work again.

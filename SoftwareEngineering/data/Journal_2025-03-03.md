Back in November, I ran into some trouble installing a Python package and I had
to set up a completely new package manager, Conda.  I didn't like how it
interfered with my shell, but it was the only way I could make progress with my
LangChain experiment at the time.

Looking back at the error message I was getting at the time, I realized it was
the same kind of C++ error I saw when I updated Ruby recently.  The platform was
using Xcode's compiler, and it couldn't find the Standard C++ Library.

I had fixed Ruby by installing the LLVM compiler.  And, it works for Python too!
I was able to get rid of Conda and manage dependencies in a simpler manner with
just `venv`.

Someone brought up
[this thread on burn out](https://twitter.com/Eeyun___/status/1379111649441878018).
I find it interesting that it coincides with
[this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html)
about someone who has also had enough with the tech industry.

Someone also brought up
[this other thread on exceptionalism](https://twitter.com/searls/status/1379461145799618564),
where we think our own business is so special that it requires custom, bespoke
solutions.  We couldn't possibly rely on something that works for everyone 
else.  What would be special in that?

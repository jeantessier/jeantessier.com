I read an
[[https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/dataAccessRoutines.pdf][article by Martin Fowler on accessors]].
It reiterated some of the ground rules regarding an object's state and how
you expose it to other objects.

His [[https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/][bliki]] also had a
reference to a
[[http://www.williamcaputo.com/archives/000053.html][Bill Caputo]]
piece on XP.  It's a reaction to a criticism of XP from
[[http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?ObjectId%3D3248&Function%3DDETAILBROWSE&ObjectType%3DART][Gerold Keefer]].
The whole thing seemed overinflated, but Gerold Keefer did
raise some valid questions to make you apply some critical thinking before you
implement XP in your workplace.  Fowler and Caputo are quick to remind people
that agility's focus is on people and finding ways to let a team do its work.

JavaPro also had an article on "interface-driven development".  It would
have been good, if not for the fact that I've been hearing this message ever
since I opened the GoF book on design patterns.  Since then, it has been one
of my most important design rules: code to interfaces.  I guess it needs
restating every once in a while, to make sure everyone is aware of it.

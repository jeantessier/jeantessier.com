I tried to create a trivial [Micronaut](http://micronaut.io) app to test what
was the minimal code I would need to write to have a server handle an HTTP call.
At first, Micronaut wouldn't work at all and gave me some blank error message.
Lucky for me,
[isssue 486](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/486)
in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core)
had a fix that worked out fine for me.

Once I had my trivial server up and running, I looked at the documentation for
message-driven architecture.  At work, I've been working with
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) quite a bit.  The Micronaut
documentation says that it is common for microservices to work with RabbitMQ or
[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), but it only provides instructions on how
to connect to Kafka.  I spent 5 minutes trying to setup a Kafka server using
`docker-compose`, but I couldn't quite get it right.  Some other time, perhaps.

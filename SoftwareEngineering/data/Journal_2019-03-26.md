I've been tinkering with Node as part of my
[book reviews](https://github.com/jeantessier/book-reviews) project.  I can
now cover the following needs:

- Node
- MongoDB
- REST
- JSON
- JWT

I'm still missing the frontend and unit tests.  I read something about Mocha and
Chai and Sinon and `sinon-mongoose` to do BDD, but I'm still struggling to make
them all work together.  And I know there is an AMQP plugin, but I haven't tried
it out, yet.

I'm also looking at the Micronaut angle, especially for a microservice-based
solution.  I have separate bits of code for the following combinations:

- Micronaut + GORM
- Micronaut + MongoDB
- Micronaut + JWT
- Micronaut + RabbitMQ

But I haven't tried to put them all together at once.  The MongoDB integration
is still struggling to put UUIDs in JSON payloads, so I'll probably have to stay
with MySQL for the time being.

Re-reading a Martin Fowler article on
[[https://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html][agile software development]].
The substance of the article goes back to the year 2000, with some updates until
2005, but it has survived the test of time surprisingly well.  It talks at
length to the fallacy of predictive development in software, and is very
humanistic in putting people at the center of the process.  For this last part,
he uses quotes by Alistair Cockburn.  It is a great re-read.

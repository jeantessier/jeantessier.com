I watched a great [talk on microservices](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw) by
Randy Shoup of Stitch Fix (at the time).  The talk was recorded back in 2017,
but I only found it today.

Some highlights:

- eBay's monolith: [now that's a monolith](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=16m38s).
- [Isolated persistence](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=20m33s).
- [Events as first-class constructs](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=23m2s).
- [Single system of record](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=32m6s), with every other copy is a read-only, non-authoritative cache.
- [Materialize the View](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=37m52s) instead of using `join`.
- [Workflows and sagas](https://youtu.be/E8-e-3fRHBw?t=41m44s), just like financial systems.

At Directly, we've had events as first-class constructs since 2011-02-02.  We
worked hard on isolating persistence and managing read-only cache copies when we
extracted our first microservice, back in September 2016.

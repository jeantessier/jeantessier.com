For my new language for 2008, I decided to learn Ruby.  I finished reading the
first two parts of the
[[http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-Pragmatic-Programmers-Second/dp/0974514055/ref%3Dpd%5Fbbs%5F2?ie%3DUTF8&s%3Dbooks&qid%3D1205992436&sr%3D8-2][Pick Axe]].
Last year, I learned Python and I stopped using Perl in order to force myself
to focus on Python.  One thing I really missed from Perl are the command-line
switches =-p=, =-n=, and =-i=; I could use them for quick one-off operations on
files.  In Python, I have to write a script for the simplest task.  I'm glad to
report that Ruby also has =-p=, =-n=, and =-i= switches that behave exactly as
in Perl.

Today marks one year of working from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  I
was worried, at first, about being at home all the time.  But, I am fortunate to
have a decent home office setup.  With Zoom, I have been able to maintain
contact with my colleagues.  I do miss the daily bike commute, though, even when
it was raining.

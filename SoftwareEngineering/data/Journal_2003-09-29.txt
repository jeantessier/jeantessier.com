More about this script I was talking about the other day.  It scans code to
collect lookup keys and generate a resource file with them.  I have been using
this script to verify that my resource file has all the keys needed by the
application, but my coworker justs wants to use it when he's done with his
application to generate the resource file automatically.

So today I took the script public within our development organization.
Someone complained that we should not use the script and that everyone should
maintain their resource file manually; to try an automated script is lazy and
error-prone.  *Error-prone*???  Synchronizing keys across
multiple files and doing it manually is error-prone.  Anything to automate that
is a step up!  And lazy?  Why,
[[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris][lazines]] is the
first virtue of a good programmer, according to Perl creator Larry Wall.  Of
course, he's talking about the kind of laziness that makes you do a lot of work
*now* so you don't have to do quite as much later.

I was tempted to start a flame war over this, but in the end my better
judgement prevailed.  In the process, I reacquainted myself with
[[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GodwinsLaw][Godwin's Law]].  I suggest you
do the same.

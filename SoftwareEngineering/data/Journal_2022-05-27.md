I finally started watching
[_Severance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)) and lo and
behold, it was filmed at
[Holmdel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs_Holmdel_Complex).  I worked in
that building between 1995 and 1998, when I was working for AT&T Labs.  There
was no severed floor, back then, to my knowledge.  I'm glad the building has
been restored and is back in use.

Moved some of my local tinkering projects to [[http://github.com/][github]].

    * =[[http://github.com/jeantessier][jeantessier]]/[[http://github.com/jeantessier/Mocking][Mocking]]=
    * =[[http://github.com/jeantessier][jeantessier]]/[[http://github.com/jeantessier/TwoStageGuiceProvider][TwoStageGuiceProvider]]=

And only *after* I had uploaded them did I realize that the =build.xml= file in
each project contained my account password.  Drats!  I had to go and change it
super quickly.

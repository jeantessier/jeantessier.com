I started playing a bit with [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/).  This book, by the
authors of Neo4j, could be an interesting introduction.  It is a little old,
though.

I got a free copy from [the book's website](https://graphdatabases.com),
compliments of Neo4j.  In this
[interview with one of the authors](https://youtu.be/XSrGhdzDATQ), he suggests
there might be a need for an updated, third edition.

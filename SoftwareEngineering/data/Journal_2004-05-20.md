Someone reacted to my suggestion for [Martin Fowler](MartinFowler.html)'s
article yesterday by mentioning Pete McBreen's _Software Craftsmanship_.
He said how it got him away from calling himself a
"software engineer" and changing to a "software craftsman" instead.  I went
through some of the same questioning myself a while ago, and I also feel closer
to a software craftsman than an engineer.  But the reality of it is that the
average person sees all software professionals as _software engineers_
without distinguishing between the finer points.  So I need to adjust my
message according to my audience, what else is new.

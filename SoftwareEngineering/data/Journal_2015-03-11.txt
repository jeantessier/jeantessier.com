Just as I'm in the middle of reading
_[[Books.html#The%5FResponsive%5FWeb][The Responsive Web]]_, I get an email from
[[https://www.google.com/webmasters/][Google Webmaster Tools]] to the effect
that my website is not mobile-friendly.  I suspected as much, but now they
suggest that Google will downgrade me in mobile searches because I am not
mobile-friendly.  Their tools analyze my pages and make recommendations on how
I can make them more responsive.

The first recommendation is to set the =viewport= meta header.  I think I want
to get a more holistic view of responsive design, before I blindly follow
blanket recommendations that are not taking my content into consideration.

On a separate note, I've been glancing at
[[http://facebook.github.io/react/][React]] vs.
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]] for a bit of fun.  I really liked this
[[https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/angular-vs-react-the-tie-breaker][comparison of the two]]
which makes good points about what I should be looking for in a JavaScript
framework.

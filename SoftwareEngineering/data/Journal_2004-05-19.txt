Attended tonight's BayXP meeting with guest Eric Evans.  During the talk,
there were some comments about what _software architecture_ really means
and it brought back memories of [[MartinFowler.html][Martin Fowler]]'s
article on the topic:
[[https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf][Who Needs an Architect?]]

Eric's talk was very enlightening.  He discussed his book
_Domain-Driven Development_ and how it applies to extreme programming.
His approach focuses on taking a careful look at the problem domain and
deriving the vocabulary of the project from it.  This helps keep the
customer on board.

I also met a former colleague who is now doing eXtreme Programming at his
new place of work.  He described his
[[http://slesinsky.org/brian/code/starting_xp.html?seemore=y][experience in his blog]].
Reading it brought back fond memories of my first experiments
with pair programming, and how I felt exhausted at the end of the day; but it
was a good exhaustion, coming from knowing we had accomplished a lot that day.
I'm glad Brian is enjoying his experience just as I did mine.

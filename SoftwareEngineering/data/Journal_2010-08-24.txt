I went to lunch at Google today.  A friend of mine is leaving Google and he
invited me over to catch up.  It was a little strange to set foot in the place
after ten months.  Thank goodness, it is still Nerd Mecca.  I saw a few familiar
faces around the cafeteria.  One guy hadn't even realized I was gone.

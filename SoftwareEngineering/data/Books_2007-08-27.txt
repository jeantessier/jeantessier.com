An amazing text on testing.  I read the first 200 pages, the
_narrative_, and skimmed the rest of the catalog of patterns.
It does a great job of defining a vocabulary for unit testing and
really nails down the terminology.  The narrative format really
brings the language to life, shows how all the terminology fit
together very nicely.  A must read for anyone doing unit testing
with any of the xUnit frameworks.

It seems I'm already familiar with most of the advice in this
book, but I'm still going to rifle through it, just in case.  When
I first saw it, when it came out, I thought I already did many of
the recommendations and simply disagreed with the others.  Maybe
it's time I took a better look.

This book came out at just about the same time as Java 1.4.
Many of the items could use a refresher to bring them in line with
the new language features in Java 1.5.

I was reading the second edition of
[_Grails in Action_](Books.html#Grails_in_Action_Second_Edition) and
it has a whole chapter dealing with NoSQL.  It showcases some of the more common
NoSQL databases and possible usage patterns.

- [Redis](http://redis.io/) for key/value pairs, good for caching and stats.
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for documents, good for JSON and map/reduce.
- [Neo4J](http://neo4j.com/) for graphs, might be useful for Dependency Finder.

These have good integration plugins for Grails.

Took another swing at making [[http://micronaut.io][Micronaut]] and
[[https://www.rabbitmq.com/][RabbitMQ]] together.  Now, there is an experimental
integration named =micronaut-rabbitmq= to help out.  The project creator doesn't
put a version number on the =micronaut-rabbitmq= and because only a milestone
version is currently on Maven, you have to put its version number explicitly.

It is not quite as absolutely awesome as the =rabbitmq-native= plugin for
[[http://grails.org/][Grails]]; it's missing the super easy declarative topic
and queue management, it relies heavily on annotations.

My trivial integration is on GitHub at
=[[https://github.com/jeantessier/micronaut-rabbitmq-test][jeantessier/micronaut-rabbitmq-test]]=.

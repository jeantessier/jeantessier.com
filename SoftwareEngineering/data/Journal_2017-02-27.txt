A colleague pointed me to the newly published
[[https://standards.usa.gov/][US government web design standards]].  Their 1.0
version came out on 2017-02-23.  It is a product of
[[https://18f.gsa.gov/][18F]], a government agency that promotes agile and open
source in government software.  These new standards are not groundbreaking, but
they do a good job of incorporating state-of-the-art web design principles.  I
think that having a large software user like the government standardize on grid
layouts and caring about typography will make it easier to advocate for these
things on other, smaller web projects.

Looking at [Racecar](https://github.com/zendesk/racecar#racecar) for writing
Kafka consumers in Rails apps.  I am used to having all consumers in the same
process.  It makes development easier since I only launch one process and all
consumers become active.  But Racecar works differently.  You tell it which
consumer to run, [one at a time](https://github.com/zendesk/racecar/issues/21).
If my application has 20 different consumers, I need to run at least 20
different processes.  More if I want to separate on individual partitions.  I
might make sense for a production environment, but in development?!?  I guess it
forces developers to use Docker Compose to run their local environment.

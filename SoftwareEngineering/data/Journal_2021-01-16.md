The Atom feeds for my blog and reading lists send contents as Markdown.  I read
them on [Feedly](http://feedly.com), but it does not handle Markdown.  Worse, it
just smooshes all the text together and I loose any paragraph structure.  It
would be better if the contents were HTML instead.  I generate these Atom feeds
from CGI scripts written in Perl, so I need a Perl library to convert Markdown
to HTML.  Maybe [`Text::Markdown`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Markdown) or
[`Text::MultiMarkdown`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::MultiMarkdown).

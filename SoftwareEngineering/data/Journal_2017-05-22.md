At the [API Mixtape conference](http://apimixtape.com/), everybody was talking
about [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) as the latest favorite way to build
service APIs.  Today, [GitHub](https://github.com/) announced that
[their service API now uses GraphQL](https://developer.github.com/v4/).  They
even include an Explorer that lets you issue queries and inspect results.  Or,
you can use `curl` or Postman with an OAuth token.

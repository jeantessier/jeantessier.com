I did my old commute to go to a meeting in San Francisco.  Rode my bicycle to
Caltrain.  Rode the new electrified Caltrain commuter train.  One small change,
though.  I left my bike at the bike parking by the train station and rode
electric scooters through downtown.

I rode in the late morning to catch lunch in the city.  The train was pretty
empty.  Coming back during rush hour was much, much busier.  Not quite the
overcrowding from before the pandemic, but people were shuffling bicycles around
to get their spot.

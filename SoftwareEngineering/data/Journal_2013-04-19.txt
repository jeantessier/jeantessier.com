I was listening to a Java/Groovy podcast in French called
[[http://lescastcodeurs.com/][Les Cast Codeurs Podcast]] and they mentioned a
benchmark of different web frameworks that included Grails.

    * [[http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/04/05/frameworks-round-2/][Frameworks Round 2]]

We can see that, in the context of the benchmark, Grails is at 5-15% of optimal
performance for handling JSON (the top performer is 100% and Grails is 5-15% of
that), which is not very impressive.  It fared much better when making multiple
queries against a database, where it ranked 42-57%.  Given how much development
time it saves me, I'm willing to live with that.

It still vastly outperformed RoR, whether on JRuby or on a regular Ruby VM.

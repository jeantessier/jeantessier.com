I found out there is now a
[formal definition of Markdown](http://commonmark.org/).  It means to address
some of the ambiguities in the
[original definition of Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
There is a reference implementation in JavaScript and implementations in Java
and Perl, too.  This might make it easier for me to move off of my custom wiki
notation and use something more standard, instead of
[Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown).

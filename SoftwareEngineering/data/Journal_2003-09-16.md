At the office, most developers use
[IntelliJ](http://www.intellij.com/) to write Java and JSP code.  I
use Emacs.

I have to admit that IntelliJ that I almost switched, some time back, when
I saw the support for refactoring and the "Find Usages" function, which mirrors
Dependency Finder.  Fortunately, a friend mentioned
[Xrefactory](http://www.xref-tech.com/), an emacs add-on that does
refactorings and some "find usages"-like functionality (and more).  All for the
small price of $29.00.  So I have not jumped on the IntelliJ bandwagon, yet.

The main reason I want to stay with Emacs is so I can have the same
development environment at home and at work.  I can't afford the $500.00 to buy
IntelliJ for myself.  With Emacs and Xrefactory, I have the same environment at
work and at home for Dependency Finder.  That is, until you factor in that at
work, I have a Win2k machine that is relatively robust, while at home I have a
Win98 box that is very flaky.  I cannot install Linux on it because I need
Win98 for games, both for the kids and for myself.  :-)

But these past few days, I have had to work on some JSPs that use custom
tags developed by the company.  Everyone is laughing at me as I struggle with
them in Emacs, while they are having a good time with very extensive support by
IntelliJ.  Tag name auto-completion, automatic attribute detection, the works.
Someone actually challenged me to find equivalent support for JSPs in Emacs.

I found references to
[MMM mode](http://mmm-mode.sourceforge.net/) at SourceForge.  This
allows multiple major modes to coexist in the same buffer, so HTML chunks can
use `html-mode` and scriptlets can use `java-mode` or
`jde-mode`.  From messages out there, it seems to require some
degree of adjustment to work correctly.  And the last release dates back to
February 2001.  Hasn't anyone done anything since?

Other references use
[multi-mode.el](ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/emacs-lisp/old-archive/misc/),
a GNU package that is almost 10 years old!

Is there no hope for me to find a decent Emacs add-on for JSPs?  Will I
have to give up my beloved Emacs and succumb to IntelliJ?

On another note, I rediscovered
[Half-Life](http://www.gameoftheyear.com/).  I have been playing
most evenings instead of thinking about Dependency Finder.  I even reinstalled
Opposing Force and managed to make some progress in it too.

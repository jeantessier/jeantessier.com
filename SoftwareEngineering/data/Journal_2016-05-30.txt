Looked at using
[[https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/][GitHub Pages]] to
document my [[https://github.com/jeantessier/book-reviews][Book Reviews]] pet
project.

In the process, I started looking into [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]], as it
is the preferred engine for GitHub Pages.  I like how it has built-in support
for blogs using a filename format that's very close to my own home-grown blog.
Maybe I should consider switching parts (or all) of my website to my GitHub User
Pages.

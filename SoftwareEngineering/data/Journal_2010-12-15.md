Getting a little more familiar with [jQuery](http://docs.jquery.com/) and some
JavaScript.  I have solid backend skills, and my HTML is pretty good.  I can do
some straightforward CSS but my JavaScript is still my weak point.  I just hate
having to write and maintain multiple versions of the same code for different
platforms.  In all my current languages (Java, Ruby, etc.), the code is the same
on all platforms.  With JavaScript's uneven support in various browsers, it's
hard to do something non-trivial that will work cleanly across all browsers.
This has been a real demotivator for me trying to learn this stuff so far.

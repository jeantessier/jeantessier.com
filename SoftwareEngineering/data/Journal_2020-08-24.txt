Migrated my [[https://mlab.com/][mLab]] MongoDB sample databases to
[[https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas][MongoDB Atlas]].  I was glad to see there
was a free tier there too, though it was slightly more involved to setup.
MongoDB Atlas makes things like clusters and availability zones more explicit,
so you have to make some choices even for the simplest of setups.

I tried to set them up in a West Coast datacenter, but in order to use their
migration tool to move my data from mLab, they had to be in the same
availability zone.  So for now, my sample databases are still on the East Coast.

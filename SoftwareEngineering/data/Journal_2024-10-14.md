Updating myself with regard to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).  I
found an old "Hello World" function in Python that I hadn't touched since
2022-05-18.  I was able to create a matching "Hello World" in Ruby and play with
it using the Lambda console, but how would I bring it under source control?  The
Lambda console has a crude versioning functionality that lets you take snapshots
of your functions, but I was thinking more along the lines of Git, if truth be
told.

I updated my AWS CLI and found the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), with
its separate CLI.  With it, I was able to create a new function on my laptop,
put it under Git, edit it with a JetBrains IDE, run it locally, and attempt to
deploy it to AWS.  I also found ways to use GitHub Actions to deploy it to AWS
automatically.

I am still struggling to get my AWS access token in the right shape to let me
deploy to AWS.  I have some test users under IAM, but it looks like AWS is
moving to a new IAM Identity Center.  I might have to create new tests accounts
with new access tokens.  But for now, all I get is "invalid token" errors.

I'm rewriting "Books.html" to generate a set of static HTML pages that I can then
upload, instead of generating everything from scratch every time.  I will still
need to assemble them into some kind of navigation structure.

My Perl is rusty.  I'm only sticking with it because I don't feel like
re-writing all the wiki-like conversions.  The are a bunch of Perl regular
expressions and mapping them to another language would be delicate.  It might be
more expedient to redo this logic in something like Groovy than stick to Perl.

I've been upgrading my laptop to Ruby `3.4.2`.

I couldn't upgrade some Rails applications because Bundler was not able to
compile the native extensions of the `sassc` gem.  The underlying compiler
couldn't locate some dependencies.

After some time on Google, I found some posts by  others that hinted at the
`CXX` setting in `rbconfig.rb` in my Ruby `3.4.2` installation.  Mine was set to
`false` while the posts recommended `clang++`.  I compared `rbconfig.rb` across
my various Ruby installations.  Some said `clang++`, but most said `false`.

The MacOS version of `clang` says its version 16.  I tried setting `CXX` to
`clang++`, as suggested, but then the underlying compiler was unable to locate
some library.  Either I needed to set more configuration variables in
`rbconfig.rb` to point to some library location, or I needed something else.

Some of the posts on the Internet mentioned LLVM.  I used Homebrew to install
it, and it contained its own version of `clang` and `clang++`, but this time it
was version 19.  I adjusted my environment variables (`PATH`, `LDFLAGS`, and
`CPPFLAGS`) to give LLVM precedence over the default `clang`.

I recompiled Ruby `3.4.2`, and I was finally able to install the `sassc` gem.

But I was not able to install the `rdkafka` gem.

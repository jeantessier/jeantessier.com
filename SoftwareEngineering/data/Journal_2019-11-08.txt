I learned much more than I ever cared to know about the =file(1)= Unix command.

[[https://fatbusinessman.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit][This article]] talks
about crafting Git commit messages, but I lost myself in the example that they
give.  The author of that commit was using =find(1)= and =file(1)= to make sure
all their files were good.  I applied the same treatment to my website and found
some interesting tidbits.  Some files had non-ASCII characters.  One text file
came up as C++ because one line started with the word "class".  Some text files
came up as HTML because they had snippets in them.  I got to read up on how
=file(1)= uses _magic_ files to try and guess the types of files.  And I also
got to search for ways to coax it to the correct answer, sometimes.

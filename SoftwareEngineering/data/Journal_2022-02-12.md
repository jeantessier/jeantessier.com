Dan North has fleshed out some of his thoughts on
[CUPID](https://dannorth.net/2022/02/10/cupid-for-joyful-coding/) into a
standalone narrative.  He talks again about how using _properties_ instead of
_principles_ leads to "centered sets" with a goal to move towards.  I've been
using a football analogy lately were there is not just one goal at the center,
but an entire endzone.  Anywhere in endzone is valid, and there are many ways to
get in the endzone.  Specific players specialize in specific paths to the
endzone, and sometimes they lose perspective that other paths can be just as
valid as theirs, depending on context and circumstances.

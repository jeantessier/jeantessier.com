An episode of
[Agile for Humans](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZYWqpkc-YzAndAt90arxTA)
podcast is dealing with
[commitments in Scrum](https://youtu.be/-F18J3o_gO4?t=71).  They draw a
distinction between _commitment_ as dedication and _commitment_ as
responsibility.  And they are very clear that, in their view, Scrum teams should
never commit to scope.

I have had experiences in the past where a team lead would pick stories from the
product backlog to create the current sprint's sprint backlog, and treat it as a
commitment.  Whatever we decided to do, we had to deliver.

I find it foolish to make such a commitment, when there are a large number of
unknowns that might make you miss on some of these stories: they may be more
complicated than they apprear, team members may be sick or otherwise
unavailable, other work may infringe on the time you can dedicate to the sprint.
Many of these things are beyond our control and may be completely unforeseen at
the beginning of the sprint.

It is more realistic to treat the spring backlog as aspirational.  We'll try our
best, but we cannot guarantee everything will get delivered.  Our commitment to
the scope is to the extent that we'll dedicate out time and resources to its
pursuit.  We cannot promise the final outcome, though.

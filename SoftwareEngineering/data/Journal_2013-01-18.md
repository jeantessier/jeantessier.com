Found two interesting tools.

[YSlow](http://yslow.org) is a browser plugin that analyses a page and gives
you advise to make it better.  It looks at how the code is organized how has
rules for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It also looks at all the resources the
page tries to load and makes recommendations on those too.

[Time.is](http://time.is) shows you the current time in another city.  You can
even show multiple timezones side-by-side so you can plan meetings and get
togethers.  Just append `/your_city` to the URL, like:

- [Montr&eacute;al](http://time.is/montreal)
- [Cluj](http://time.is/cluj)

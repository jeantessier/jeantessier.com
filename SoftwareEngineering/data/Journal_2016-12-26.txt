Discovered [[https://surge.sh/][Surge]], a tool and site where you can publish
any static website and/or Single Page Apps.  It integrates with popular frontend
development technologies so it can become part of the development workflow.  It
is pretty cool how they setup projects as subdomains of =surge.sh=.  This way,
you can host your project at a mostly readable URL without having to purchase a
domain and pay for hosting.  It can also host your site if you purchased a
domain name and you just need some place to host it.  In my case, I already pay
for hosting with Dreamhost, and I have unlimited subdomains for
=*.jeantessier.com=, so all I would need, really, is the automation.  I already
jury-rigged a GitHub automation that updates my main website with every
=git push= to the repository, but it relies on a GitHub webhook and a custom CGI
script.

Surge uses the =.sh= TLD.  It is for
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena,_Ascension_and_Tristan_da_Cunha][Saint Helena]],
a group of British islands in the South Atlantic.

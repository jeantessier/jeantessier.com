The [[https://afternoon-cliffs-9951.herokuapp.com/Books.html][test app]] I wrote
on [[2016-01-02]], when playing with the MEAN stack, has stopped working.  The
endpoint that returns public data still works, but the endpoints for logging in
or signing up no longer work.  Something must have changed in one or more of the
dependencies.  I guess I will have to work my way through updated
[[http://www.passportjs.org/][Passport]] tutorials to track down what has
changed.  I did notice a
=[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local-mongoose][passport-local-mongoose]]=
strategy that seems to offer better integration with
[[http://mongoosejs.com/][Mongoose]].  It also mentions moving from SHA-1 to
SHA-256, which makes me wonder if my app stopped working because of some
security fix somewhere in the chain of dependencies.

I installed
=[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates][npm-check-updates]]=, or
=ncu=, to help me manage package versions.  I read about it
[[http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/update-npm-packages/][here]].  It updated
quite a few of my dependencies, but the =/login= and =/register= endpoints are
still not working.

Dragged my direct coworkers (3 + my direct report) to a rehearsal for a talk
I have to give tommorrow to the full Engineering department.  They were very
reluctant at first to have me waste a whole 3 minutes of their time.  They even
enquired if attending tommorrow's was necessary after having been through the
rehearsal.  Now it's not like I only see these people once a week.  I go to
lunch with them almost everyday, we sit in a bullpen together.  We complain
about the same things together.  By now you should get it that we're fairly
close to each other.  And yet they would not lend me a hand when I asked for a
test audience for my talk.  It depressed me a little.

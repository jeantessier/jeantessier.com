Just as I'm in the middle of reading
[_The Responsive Web_](Books.html#The_Responsive_Web), I get an email from
[Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) to the effect
that my website is not mobile-friendly.  I suspected as much, but now they
suggest that Google will downgrade me in mobile searches because I am not
mobile-friendly.  Their tools analyze my pages and make recommendations on how
I can make them more responsive.

The first recommendation is to set the `viewport` meta header.  I think I want
to get a more holistic view of responsive design, before I blindly follow
blanket recommendations that are not taking my content into consideration.

On a separate note, I've been glancing at
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) vs.
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for a bit of fun.  I really liked this
[comparison of the two](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/angular-vs-react-the-tie-breaker)
which makes good points about what I should be looking for in a JavaScript
framework.

Worked through some basic [Angular](https://angular.io/) tutorials.  My "blog"
is an old [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) app that needs modernizing.  I
could rewrite it using [React](https://reactjs.org/), but this could be an
opportunity to learn some basic Angular.  It was easy to include some of the old
AngularJS in an existing HTML page.

I feel that the new Angular will be more like an entire app, similar to how the
[BookReviews](https://github.com/jeantessier/book-reviews-react-app) React app
is its own set of files with its own `index.html` entrypoint.  I was able to
force the React entrypoint by setting `homepage` in `package.json` and then
copy its `index.html` to [`Books.html`](Books.html) to install multiple versions
of the app with different datasets.  I don't know if Angular can do the same to
replace the current [`Journal.html`](Journal.hml).

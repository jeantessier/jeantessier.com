MEAN ties the latest web development technologies together, the way LAMP tied
the early open source stack, years ago.  This book should be a decent intro to
the key players.

So far, the parts about [[https://nodejs.org/en/][node.js]] and
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]] are pretty good.

_More to come._

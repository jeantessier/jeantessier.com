I assisted at a presentation by Ken Schwaber on Scrum and got a free copy of
his book: Agile Project Management with Scrum.  He is a very good speaker.  He
sounded very honest and he shared his experience freely.  Later in the day, he
had a more intimate session with the agile user group.  The organizer had asked
for questions ahead of time but Ken completely highjacked the meeting and took
it where he wanted to take it.  It was very intereting.  He basically forced us
to question why we care about agile processes and what our goals are and what
are we doing to make track against them.

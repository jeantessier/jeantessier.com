I was reading Brian Marick's blog
_[Oddly Influenced](https://blog.oddly-influenced.dev/)_ and I noticed he also
uses [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) for his styling.  I
put all my articles together on one very long page, but Marick's blog is more
SEO friendly.  The home page lists just a handful of the most recent articles,
with a small excerpt for each one.  I can use the browser's "find in page"
feature to search my blog.  I didn't see any way to search Marick's blog.

I was reading
[[https://hackernoon.com/not-a-cultural-fit-bf398bc0e99b][an article on cultural fit]]
where they talked about the gig economy and how "individual employees [...]
should think of themselves as businesses."  This brought to my mind Reid
Hoffman's [[http://amzn.com/0307888908][The Start-Up of You]].  But the article
showed that the idea went back much farther, mentioning the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society][Mount Pelerin Society]],
a liberal group of philosophers that started in 1947.  An interesting discovery.

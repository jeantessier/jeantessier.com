I tried different ways to render the Rub code snippet from yesterday.  Once with
[[https://carbon.now.sh/][Carbon]] and another way with a
[[https://gist.github.com/][GitHub Gist]].

Here is the result with Carbon:

[[data-driven-rspec.png]]

It looks nice, but it's an image.  That means it will not match keyword searches
and people cannot cut-and-paste it into their code.

I tried to embed the
[[https://gist.github.com/jeantessier/c514cbb2071bf7badbc6356fc4210313][Gist]]
into this blog, but this is done with a =&lt;script&gt;= tag.  This blog happens
to be a small [[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]] app that sanitizes data, so
it scrubs out the tag to prevent XSS exploits.

    &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/jeantessier/c514cbb2071bf7badbc6356fc4210313.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jeantessier/c514cbb2071bf7badbc6356fc4210313.js"></script>

I looked for ways to mark the blog content as trusted HTML, or even to turn off
sanitization altogether, but no success.  This is AngularJS, old technology.  I
could rewrite the app using [[https://angular.io/][Angular]].  Maybe the
sanitization controls are easier to operate there.  And, there is always
[[https://reactjs.org/][React]].

Created an account on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to try out
[OpenCommit](https://github.com/di-sukharev/opencommit).  It uses ChatGPT to
generate commit messages.  I kept getting `429: Too Many Requests` when I tried
it out with my free trial plan, though.

The integration with Git is really nice, though.  You just use `opencommit`
instead of `git commit`.  Or, you can set it up as a pre-commit check that
generates the initial commit text and continue using Git as usual.

Stumbled upon a way to split the initialization of an object across multiple
_providers_ when doing dependency injection in Java with
[Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/).  I will document it more
fully on a separate page.

I wrote some sample code and gave JUnit 4.5 a try.  In the past, I have always
been limited to JUnit 3 for one reason or another.  But now, I got to write
some tests using annotations and the new `assertThat()` with Hamcrest matchers.
It was nice, except that I couldn't really inherit from `MockObjectTestCase`
anymore, and I have to explicitly declare the jMock `context` in my tests.

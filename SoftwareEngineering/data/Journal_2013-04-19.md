I was listening to a Java/Groovy podcast in French called
[Les Cast Codeurs Podcast](http://lescastcodeurs.com/) and they mentioned a
benchmark of different web frameworks that included Grails.

- [Framework Benchmarks](http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/03/28/framework-benchmarks/)
- [Frameworks Round 2](http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/04/05/frameworks-round-2/)

We can see that, in the context of the benchmark, Grails is at 5-15% of optimal
performance for handling JSON (the top performer is 100% and Grails is 5-15% of
that), which is not very impressive.  It fared much better when making multiple
queries against a database, where it ranked 42-57%.  Given how much development
time it saves me, I'm willing to live with that.

It still vastly outperformed RoR, whether on JRuby or on a regular Ruby VM.

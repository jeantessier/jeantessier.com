I worked with Sam a few years ago and I'm curious to see what he's been up to.
And microservices are all the rage, right now.  At work, I'm struggling with a
monolith; we cannot upgrade the technology stack because the task is too big.
With a microservice-based approach, we would have had small pieces that we could
upgrade one at a time.

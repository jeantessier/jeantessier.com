XPers are a just bunch of hackers.

I sent a message to a couple of mailing lists regarding a design issue I've
been having at work, and they completely missed the point.  I described the
situation in a few classes and two alternatives, inquiring which one looked
best.  Their first reaction: this reeks of big design upfront, too much
complexity, this is all bogus.  It never occurred to them that there might
exist situations where that is the simplest design that might work.  They
immediately went into a frenzy about only custom code is good enough.  I never
occured to them that I might have ended up there by refactoring some simple
solution already.  There was no benefit of the doubt, I was labelled a BDUFer
the moment I set foot in there.

It just makes me mad.

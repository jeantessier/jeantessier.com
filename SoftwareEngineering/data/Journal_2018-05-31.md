One more note on pull vs. push management.  This
[HBR article on scaling agile](https://hbr.org/2018/05/agile-at-scale)
contrasts _creative teams_ with _command-and-control groups_.  Agile teams have
more autonomy, push decisions closer to people doing the work, leaders remove
obstacles.  Looks like pull management to me.  Traditional teams have layers of
control, chain-of-command bureaucracies, top-down plans, leaders that delegate
to subordinates.  Push management, anyone?

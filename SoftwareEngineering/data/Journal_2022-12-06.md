At work, we mostly use VS Code.  There is a small group that is trying to push
PyCharm, but our development environment does not lend itself well to local
development.  We're big on cloud-based VMs and VS Code just does a better job
under those conditions.  PyCharm can work in remote mode, but it tries to index
files over the network, which takes forever.  This being said, PyCharm is a
full IDE with better support, IMO.

Today, I saw this YouTube video where
[Lex Fridman is interviewing Guido van Rossum](https://youtu.be/G5mtQhWNezQ)
and they talk about Vim vs. Emacs vs. PyCharm vs. VS Code.  Guido makes an
interesting observation that VS Code is the new Emacs of the ease with which it
can be extended.  It is possible to write plugins for PyCharm, but it is fairly
complicated.

After watching the video, I understand better what he meant.  He is taking a
wider view of software development, especially in the context of a startup.
Tying in to the other talks at the conference, startups are where we search for
working business models.  We have to maximize learning, sometimes at the
expense of perfect engineering.  But we cannot sacrifice engineering so much
that it jeopardizes future learning.  We have to still do enough engineering,
but not more.  This is not a _carte blanche_ for hacking, merely a reminder
not to lose sight of the real goal.

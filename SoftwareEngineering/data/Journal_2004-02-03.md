I read
[a paper by Allan Shalloway](http://www.netobjectives.com/ezines/ezine_2004_01.pdf),
of _Design Patterns Explained_ fame, on the
usefulness of design patterns.  Again, he warns not focus too much on the
particular solution, but rather on the forces at play in the pattern and how
they are resolved.  That's where the true value of design patterns is.  Some of
it boils down to the usual "program to an interface, not an implementation" and
"favor composition over inheritance".  As always, you want to encapsulate what
changes to limit the impact of these changes to the rest of the code.

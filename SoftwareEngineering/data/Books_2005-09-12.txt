I remember the first edition being a must-read for anyone doing
C++.

I'm starting on a C++ project, so I'm reading this to refresh my
memory about all the C++ pitfalls.  This new edition has been
updated to address today's use of templates, the STL, and design
patterns in general.  So far, every paragraph reminds me of why I
prefer Java.  :-)

Template Meta-Programming.  Brrr.

Still a must-read for anyone doing C++.  Here's a language with
a million little gotchas, and they are all documented in this book.
No one should be doing C++ without this book by their side.

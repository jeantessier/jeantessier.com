Good introduction to design patterns and some of the higher
principles of object-oriented design.  Follows my own personal
discovery of the fundamental principle of isolating change.  I
discovered it while I was reading Wolfgang Pree's
_Design Patterns for Object-Oriented Software Development_, right
after I had read the Gang of Four book in 1994.

A good book for junior developers, but I am way beyond it by
now.

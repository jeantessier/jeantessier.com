Came upon an article on Medium about
[[https://medium.com/gusto-engineering/i-didnt-want-to-be-a-manager-anymore-and-the-world-didn-t-end-e92427fe8b55][someone trying out management]]
and deciding on a career outside of management.  The bits about management had
echoes of _[[../Books.html#Radical%5FCandor][Radical Candor]]_, and I liked how
the author also took time to describe contributors and technical leaders as
highly valuable career choices too.

However, I didn't like how the author saw the manager as this super person, who
maybe knows more or knows better than the people who report to them, who can get
them unstuck by their brilliant insights, who knows how they can get better.
When it comes to technical or creative work, I much prefer a manager that
creates the right environment for the team and team members to solve their own
problems.  People need to find their own answers, not get them handed from above
by someone who is potentially increasingly getting out of touch.  The manager
needs to understand the nature of the work, but should leave the getting lost in
it to their team.

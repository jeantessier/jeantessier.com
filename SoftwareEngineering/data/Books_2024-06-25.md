My code is on GitHub.  GitHub Actions make it possible to have some form of
CI/CD to do some post-processing every time I commit changes.  I am hoping this
book will help me grok all that I can do using GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions has [extensive documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
So why buy a book about it when all this documentation is available for free?  I
usually have a hard time following online documentation.  It is fine if you want
to zero in on something and get exhaustive information about it.  But if you
don't know what you need to look for, it can be frustrating.  A book provides
better context and a more cohesive learning experience.

As much as I want the book to cover and explain all the pieces, I realize GitHub
Actions will evolve and the book will become obsolete over time.  They have to
balance explaining something right then and there versus providing a link to the
latest online documentation.  The authors often provide a cursory look at a
given concept and follow it with a "for more, look up this link."

WebStorm has decent support for GitHub workflows.  The book also mentions VS
Code.

I can write GitHub actions as Docker images that run on _runners_.  Maybe I can
use a Docker image of Dependency Finder to create multiple actions that match
what's offered by the Ant tasks.  A repo could use GitHub actions to build its
software, and then run either `JarJarDiff` or `OOMetrics` to generate reports.

_More to come._

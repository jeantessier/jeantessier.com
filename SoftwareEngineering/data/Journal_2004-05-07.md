I just love it when I read about a new pattern only to find out that it
describes something I was already doing for some time.  This happened today,
as a discussion on a mailing list pointed me to the Unit of Work pattern.  It
is described in a lot of details in [Martin Fowler](MartinFowler.html)'s
book _Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture_ and is at the heart
of the [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) framework.

The basic idea is to have an object, the unit of work, keep track of all
changes to a group of objects you've read from the database (or created or
deleted).  When you are done manipulating these objects, you commit the unit of
work object, which saves all changes to the database simultaneously.  It does
not address distributed databases and two-phase commit issues, but these could
be orthogonal concerns, handled within the unit of work object itself, I
guess.

It turns out that I did something similar on my own  few years back, where
individual changes to existing objects were persisted immediately but creations
and deletions were accumulated in a _Transaction_ object and committed
together.  It may very well be that by reading a lot about patterns and
database mapping, I unconsciously absorbed the patterns and then recalled it
when a need arose.  It's just cool that I now come across this documented piece
of knowledge that validates my decision from back then.

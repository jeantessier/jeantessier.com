Read two very different articles about one-on-one meetings.

The first one

is very condescending towards the employee.  It's really about the making the
manager feel good that they are in control of the situation.  The manager owns
the employee and should find what works best for them.  It reads like a
get-rich-quick scam: do these _n_ easy steps and success will be yours.  Many of
the questions are very personal and may not be appropriate unless the two are
close friends.  And what comes through is a pervasive feeling of
_how can you be a better employee, what else can you do for the company_.

does a much better job of making the meeting about the employee and making sure
it is empowering them.  They drive much of the interactions.  I felt it did a
better job of treating the employee in a holistic manner, being mindful that
they are whole persons, and each is best qualified to deal with their
challenges.  This reminds me of the organizing principle for teams at Google:
let the contributors make the decisions, since they know best what is needed and
they have to live with the consequences.  Empowering the team is the best way to
unlock its full potential.  The second article does the same thing for employees
through their one-on-one meetings.

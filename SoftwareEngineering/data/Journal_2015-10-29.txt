They propose to form teams around features instead of roles.  This gives more
independence to remote groups and reduces friction since as they grow more
confident, they can own more decisions.

I wonder what would happen if instead of breaking up a classic organization to
make some of the parts remote, we started with an open source organization
instead.  Open source is much more decentralized and members can maintain
completely independent schedules.  Which agile practices would make continue to
make sense and which ones would be irrelevant?

Finally managed to replace some of my CGI scripts with
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]] applications.  The apps get their contents
from CGI scripts that read from the =data= directory and produce JSON.  I
started working on them after reading
[[Books.html#AngularJS%5Fin%5FAction][AngularJS in Action]], but got stuck after
my code landed in an infinite loop.  I caught a break by looking at the
AngularJS chapters of
[[Books.html#Getting%5FMEAN][Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node]].

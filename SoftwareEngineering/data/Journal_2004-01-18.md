I saw that [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) is hiring.
Someone posted on the `pragprog` list that they were applying there
and wanted a little more information regarding their hiring process.  Now,
[Martin Fowler](MartinFowler.html) works there and I like him very
much.  At UML 2000, he had talked about the place and seemed very ecstatic about
it.  He is big on XP, and Alistair Cockburn referred to some of Fowler's
experiences with XP at ThoughtWorks.  So I took a look at their website, and it
turns out they have a office right here in San Francisco.  My commute wouldn't
even have to change, their office is right by the train station.  Now it
remains for me to see if I'm ready to move on and if I'd like to work as a
consultant.  I'm still far from decided on either count.

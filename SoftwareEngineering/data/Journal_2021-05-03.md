I was talking about UML with a colleague the other day.  I was recommending they
learn the basics of it so they can use the notation when explaining or
documenting their code.  It just so happened that this morning, I saw two
articles on why we don't hear much about UML anymore:
[Why UML "Really" Died](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-uml-really-died)
and
[Can Formal Methods Succeed where UML Failed?](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/can-formal-methods-succeed-where-uml-failed)

I looked at the specification of UML 2.0 the other day and I was astounded by
the complexity I found.  I don't believe in doing code generation from a
diagram;  the amount of detail that is necessary is much better expressed in
textual code.  Plus, it is very hard to put diagrams under version control and
there is no good way to merge diffs, so we cannot collaborate or evolve a
diagram over time.  But there is still a lot of value in skething using UML.  It
helps my think better by raising the level of abstraction.  I find it useful
when documenting a design for the same reason.  It lets us take in the forrest
before we start looking at each tree.  This is definitely a case where 20% of
the notation takes us 80% of the way.

McKinsey published a (misguided)
[report about programmer productivity](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/yes-you-can-measure-software-developer-productivity#/).
Here is some criticism from a few software engineers from the agile community:

- Kent Beck ([part 1](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity), [part 2](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-440))
- Gergely Orosz ([part 1](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity), [part 2](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-part-2))
- [Dave Farley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuUBZ1pByzM)
- [Dan North](https://dannorth.net/2023/09/02/the-worst-programmer/)

Basically, measuring developers' individual actions is self-defeating.
Whichever metrics you decide upon will get gamed by someone.  The performance of
a software team is best managed by monitoring the overall impact of the team's
work.

I learned today that people are spreading nasty rumors about me at my old
job.  Apparently, someone accused me of having badmouthed the company during my
last days there; which is simply not true.  It is a great company with a great
product and I wish them all the success in the world (I own stock in the
company, after all).  And then, someone else questioned my behavior after I'd
given my notice.  I continued working to the best of my ability and even
volunteered for a task that took most of my last week and involved training a
newbie at the same time.  If this is reprehensible, I hope everyone is just as
bad as me when they leave their job.

A friend told me to forget about it and not let it get to me.  But I feel
hurt and it cast a shadow on what's otherwise been a great week at my new job.
I'll heed the advice and not pursue the matter any further.  It's just
disappointing when you work hard to preserve relationships and one bad apple
can undo it all and there's not much you can do about it.  I can only hope that
the people there will see this for what it is.

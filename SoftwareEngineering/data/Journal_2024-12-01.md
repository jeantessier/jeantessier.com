I'm trying my hand again at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).
They're small coding assignments.  It makes me think of a Lego  advent I saw
once where each day was a tiny Lego model.  I'll be doing Advent of Code in
Ruby and
[putting it on GitHub](https://github.com/jeantessier/advent-of-code-2024).
It's a good opportunity for me to practice my Ruby.

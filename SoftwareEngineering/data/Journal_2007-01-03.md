Got Python for my PCs from [python.org](http://python.org/).

I found some good candidates for books on Python:

- [Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition](http://amzn.com/0596100469)
- [Learning Python](http://amzn.com/0596002815)
- [Programming Python](http://amzn.com/0596009259)
- [Python Cookbook](http://amzn.com/0596007973)
- [Python Essential Reference, 3rd Edition](http://amzn.com/0672328623)

Obviously, they modeled _Learning Python_ and _Programming Python_ on the very
popular titles for Perl.  But whereas _Programming Python_ is much more popular
than _Learning Perl_, it appears to be the reverse with Python and
_Learning Python_ gets more stars on Amazon than _Programming Python_.  Curious.

There is also a pretty cool
[online tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html).

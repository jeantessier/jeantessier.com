I worked through the turorial for [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/).  I had
to turn on remote login on my MacBook Pro to get the pseudo-distributed mode
running.  It was really cool to see MapReduce running.

I got an [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) account when I read
about [Amazon Elastic MapReduce](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/).  It
is an on-demand Hadoop cluster for running MapReduce jobs.  Cool!  You pay only
for what you use, by the hour.  Unfortunately, there is no way for developers
to run small jobs on it for free either to get more familiar with the technology
or developing a new job.  The minimum cost appears to be $0.10, but these can
accumulate quickly.  And while you can do test runs on your local machine, it
doesn't take into account all the other provisioning that you might need to do
to run on the Elastic MapReduce.  Amazon's pricing information hints at separate
EC2 and S3 charges, so there might be more to running a Hadoop job on Amazon.

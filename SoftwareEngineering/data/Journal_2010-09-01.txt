    clear and readable

I've been interested in fonts lately.  At work, we started using
[[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museo.html][Museo]] for the
[[http://shopwell.com][website]].  It got me thinking that I could spruce up
this blog (and my reading reviews) with some clever use of fonts.

I try not to customize my environment too much anymore, because then it gets
strange when I have to work on a non-customized machine.  Managing long lists
of fonts has always been problematic.  It's even worse on the web since you
cannot assume what's gonna be available in the user's browser.  That's why so
far, I've been relying solely on the lowest possible common denominator when
doing web work, which means the
[[http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/fonts.html#generic-font-families][generic font families]]
in CSS.

But now, there are all kinds of web fonts becoming available.  Browsers can
download them from the web as needed and use them to render text.  This opens up
a whole new world of possibilities.  Now, the problem becomes choosing the best
font among the thousands that are available.  And making sure that the terms of
usage let me use them for free.

For now, I'm experimenting with a simple ="font-family: cursive"= until I can
find time for more exploration.  I also installed Anonymous Pro in my IDE to try
it out.  So far, it looks a little clearer than the default _monospaced_.  Other
fixed-width alternatives looked good too but the code highlighting was not as
effective.  This new font looks well calibrated.

Catching up on Dan North's [CUPID](https://youtu.be/knNaUSLhx-U) as a response
to Uncle Bob's SOLID.  I like how he positions his properties against the SOLID
principles.  Properties define a _center_ and a distance from that center, as
opposed to principles that define an all-or-nothing _boundary_.  Of course, you
don't have choose only one approach.  They are not mutually exclusive.

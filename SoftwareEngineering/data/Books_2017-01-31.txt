After reading a few articles by [[http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/][DHH]] on
[[https://m.signalvnoise.com/@dhh][Medium]], I figured I'd look at his books.

This book is about both running an distributed organization and working for one.
Companies need to go after the best talent, wherever it is, and not limit
themselves to the local talent pool.  Employees need to look for the best
opportunities, wherever they are, and not limit themselves to local employers.
Today's technology can really make remote work happen.

So far, much like [[#Rework][Rework]], it reads more like a collection of
opinions than an in-depth exploration of their subject.

_More to come._

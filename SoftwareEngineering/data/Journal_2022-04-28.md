A (younger) co-worker compared me to
[Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), today, as we
were discussing Emacs and I was using lots of shell commands to do a deployment.
I should be flattered, I guess??  The man is a legend and software development
owes a lot to him.  But, he also had his share of controversies, and he has
some, let us say, _strongly held opinions_.  I thought it was funny, especially
in light of his portrayal by [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/225/) as a sword-wielding
defender of coders.

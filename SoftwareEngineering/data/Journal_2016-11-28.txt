A co-worker brought to my attention a new feature introduced in Java 7 to
[[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/catch-multiple.html][catch multiple unrelated exceptions]]
in one =catch= block.

    try {
        // Do something
    } catch (IOException | SqlException ex) {
        // Handle exception
    }

The compiler still creates separate _exception handler_ attributes, but they all
share the same series of instructions.  With separate =catch= blocks, even if
they have identical code, the compilation duplicates all the instructions.  This
new notation is both elegant *and* more efficient.

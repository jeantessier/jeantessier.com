I always thought the median of a list of numbers had to be a member of the list
itself.  If the list has an odd number of elements, it is easy: sort them and
take the middle one as the median.  But if the list has an even number of
elements, things are more complicated: there are two values in the middle, so
which one should I choose?

Today, I was checking my understanding of medians when  I read two definitions
that went against what I had always believed.  Both
[MathIsFun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/median.html) and
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) say to 
**average the two middle values** when the list has an even number of elements.

Of course, that can only apply to lists of things that can be averaged.  A list
of strings can be sorted alphabetically, but I cannot average the two middle
values.  There, I'm back to my earlier problem of which one of the two do I
pick as the median.

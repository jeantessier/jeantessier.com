New term going around: [[https://cobwwweb.com/wtf-is-jamstack][JAMstack]].  It
stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markdown.  It describes a philosophy for
building _static_ websites, but using modern site-building tools.  For example:

* [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] for building from Markdown
* [[https://forestry.io/][Forestry]] for CMS to create contents
* [[https://www.netlify.com/][Netlify]] for refreshing the website after commits

You can create content using Markdown, keep it under source control using a Git
repository hosted somewhere, and trigger automatic rebuilds when you commit your
changes.

The toolset is getting better integrated.  I used to balk at the amount of setup
that I would need to do.  But newer solutions are taking up more and more of
that hassle.  Maybe one day I'll finally move off of my custom wiki notation and
be able to just do Markdown instead.

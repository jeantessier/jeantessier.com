Met Guido Van Rossum's wife and son at the park.  They are nice people.  I was
out playing with my kids when this lady saw my Google jacket.  She was wearing
the same.  She mentioned that her husband worked at Google, "doing things with
Python."  When I mentioned that I was just learning Python myself, she said:
"My husband wrote Python."  I said: "Guido?"  She answered yes and we had a
good laugh.

Started new job at [INSIDR](http://insidr.net/).
[ShopWell](http://shopwell.com) is owned in part by
[Social Ventur.es](http://socialventur.es).  They brought be on board their
new venture INSIDR because of my Grails knowledge and overall engineering
skills.

Setup [my profile](http://about.me/jeantessier) at
[about.me](http://about.me/).  A friend showed it to me back in October and
it's taken this long for me to get an invite to their invitation-only beta.
Well, actually, I received the invite over two weeks ago but only acted on it
now.

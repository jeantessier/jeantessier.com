Built a
[sample Rails app](https://github.com/jeantessier/rails-cancancan-example) to
explore how to do authorization in Rails.  A popular gem for doing this is
[`CanCanCan`](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) and it is what we
are using at work.

In Grails, we use Spring Security Core, which assigns roles and lets you
specify, in each controller and view, which actions are permitted and which view
elements are visible.  `CanCanCan` does it differently.  It puts all these
controls in a centralized location.  It is also finer grained in that you can
apply it to domain objects, or models, too.  This gets injected into database
queries to filter result sets to what the user is allowed to see.

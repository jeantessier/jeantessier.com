I found a cool plugin for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor that lets people
share a session for [pair programming](https://atom.io/packages/atom-pair).
You can invite others to join the session using [Slack](https://slack.com/).
At work, we have collaborators that live in Europe and this could help us pair
program.  Or even pairing with my office coworkers when one of us is working
from home.

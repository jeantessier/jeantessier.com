Someone at work circulated an HBR article on
[phrases to remove from our vocabulary during meetings](https://hbr.org/2022/01/please-stop-using-these-phrases-in-meetings).
While I disagree with pretty much everything the author said, one interesting
trick was to ask participants to write down their objectives while they wait for
everyone to assemble.  These notes are private but can help ground them for the
meeting.

_You're on mute_ is short and to the point and is immediately actionable by the
recipient.  The suggested: _If you're speaking, I can't hear you._ takes too
long and requires the receiver to diagnose what might be the problem; most of
the time, it's the mute button.

_Building the plane while flying_ is not a recommendation to be reckless.  On
the contrary, it says to make sure you can keep sustaining flight as you are
making changes.  I've heard it as: _changing the engines while flying_, which
entails that you do them one at a time, using the remaining engines to keep you
aloft.  It also means you cannot do it on a single engine airplane.  The whole
idea is that you want to make improvements, but you have to do it without
disrupting ongoing business.

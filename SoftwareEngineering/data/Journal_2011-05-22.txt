Got a call from the repair shop.  THe motherboard is fried.  They don't have a
replacement that will fit my CPU, so I need to build a new machine.  $100 plus
parts.  I found a replacement motherboard on the internet for around $200, but
the sellers are few and are unknown to me, with mixed ratings.  I'm starting to
consider getting rid of my PC altogether.  We use the Macs almost exclusively
nowadays anyway.

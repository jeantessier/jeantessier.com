I have come to realize that the essential skill for anyone who wants to do
any kind of convincing or mentoring is _empathy_.  You just have to be
able to put yourself in the other person's place and understand things from
_their_ point of view.  Not just how you would understand things if, like
them, you didn't know what you now know, but how _they_ might try to
understand things, how _they_ think, how _they_ might go about trying
to solve a problem.  The issue is not how you would do in their place, but
rather how _they_ go about it.

This came about after I discussed some complex piece of software with a
coworker.  We are both good at what we do, but I still had a hard time grasping
some of the concepts he was trying to convey.  Not because of their utmost
complexity; some of them were pretty simple.  It had more to do with how he
chose to present them to me, in a manner that made a lot of sense to him but
was quite unfamiliar to me.  I eventually got what he meant, but I had to do
quite a bit of work to get it.  If I hadn't been in need of that information, I
would not have bothered trying to understand what he was saying.

Now he could come back to me and say that I should have told him I didn't
understand what he was talking about.  But I really believe that it is the
responsibility of the communicator to get the message across.  You cannot count
on your audience to go the extra mile.  If it is important to you that your
message gets across, then it behooves you to take the steps necessary for this
to happen and communicate with your audience in a way that _they_
understand.

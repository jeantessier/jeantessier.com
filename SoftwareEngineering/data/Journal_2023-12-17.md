Day 17 of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) really got the better
of me.  We have to navigate a grid with costs on each cell and find a path with
minimal cost.  I can use
[Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for
that, but there is an additional constraint that we cannot take more than three
cells in a straight line.  I tried using the
[A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), with
Dijkstra's distances as a heuristic function, but I always get a factorial
explosion of possible paths.

There is a trick that I'm missing.

Came upon a great episode of the
[Greater Than Code](http://www.greaterthancode.com/2018/08/29/095-cleaning-house-with-heidi-waterhouse/)
podcast that talked a lot about empathy and personal space (in code).  During
the podcast, they referenced
[_the Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming_](https://the-composition.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming-bcdaf8fbe960)
where Jessica Kerr compares the emergence of the Arts during the Renaissance to
the current rise of software.  She describes _symmathesy_, evolving systems that
include both people and technology, such as a development team and the software
it maintains.  She also describes _purple people_ who have a full mental model
of the software, can perform as 10x engineers, and how they have to help other
team members gain better understanding, instead of hoarding that knowledge.

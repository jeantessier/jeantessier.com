I found an interesting article titled
[[https://twitter.com/carlopescio/status/890182579634221057?lang=en][Programming As If Domain Mattered]].
In it, the author takes a sample problem (whiteboard interview style) with an
optimized solution (in Haskell).  His contention is that while optimal, the
solution is so removed from the problem domain that any change in the problem
requires a complete overhaul of the solution.  A less optimized solution that
models the domain more closely may be easier to modify as the domain changes,
especially for large code bases dealing with real world problem, where it would
be impractical to start over.

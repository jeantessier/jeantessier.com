I've been curious about Hadoop for some time.  MapReduce is such an exciting
paradigm and I didn't get to do enough of it when I was at Google.  I tried to
use a 50% off coupon to buy this title directly from the publisher's website,
but ended up buying the ebook instead of the paper book.  It's great to have the
ebook so I can do searches in the text, but I cannot read an entire book on my
computer screen; so I had to buy it one more time to get the printed version.

I have been trying to wrap my head around [[https://reactjs.org/][React]] for
the longest time.  Somehow, it always rebuffs my attempts at understanding what
I'm looking at.  But I finally found a
[[https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html][really great explanation]]
that walks me through all the concepts in a way that I can grok them.  I'm still
missing some of the setup to allow me to play with it on my own, but at least I
can read it now.

I was reading the [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) 
[Technology Radar](https://assets.thoughtworks.com/assets/technology-radar-nov-2016-en.pdf)
where they were signing the praise of [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/).  So I
made my way through their quickstart tutorial.

Incidentally, the technology radar also said to keep away from
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

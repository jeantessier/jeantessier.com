Looking at what it would take to migrate to Markdown, again.

I looked at [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown][Showdown]] (290k weekly
downloads).  I have a proof-of-concept with an
[[https://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]] app.  The documentation talks about using
it with [[https://angular.io/][Angular]], but my Book Reviews app is in
[[https://reactjs.org/][React]].  I guess it's simple enough to use that I could
work it into my React app.

Or, I could use
=[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown][react-markdown]]= instead (523k
weekly downloads).  It is made for React and it is even simpler to use.

I might have to make do with using Showdown on the blog, which is still in
AngularJS, and =react-markdown= with the reading lists.  There is a small risk
that their Markdown implementations will diverge on the fringes, but I doubt it
will impact me.  What I need is pretty minimal.

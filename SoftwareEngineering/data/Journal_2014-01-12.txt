As part of re-writing "Books.cgi", I added a piece to generate an list of books
that I can use as an index during navigation.  The mix of Perl and embedded HTML
is really awkward.

I also took a very first stab at combining this index with some kind of
navigation based on jQuery.  It failed miserably, so I still have quite a bit of
work to do.

I learned today, quite by accident, that John Vlissides passed away a few
days ago.  He was one of the "Gang of Four", the writers of
[[http://amzn.com/0201633612][Design Patterns]].
I was fortunate enough to meet him, once, at PLoP '96.  He was on my workgroup
and he was a very positive influence.  He was very nice and he liked my paper
a lot.  :-)

I was presenting the patterns from my MSc work.  The one about
[[http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~keller/Layla/remote.pdf][Remote Operation]]
caught his eye and I remember him saying he wished he had had it
when they were writing the Proxy pattern.  I was quite awed that one of
software's great would appreciate my work.  During the workshop sessions, he
was just one of us, looking at papers and commenting constructively on them.
I fell very fortunate for these few moments spent in his company back then.

John Vlissides died on November 24, 2005, after a long fight with cancer.
There is a [[http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?JohnVlissides][memorial]] on
Ward Cunningham's original Wiki.

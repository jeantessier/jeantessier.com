Reading on GitHub webhooks, so I can automate updating the website whenever I
push commits to the repo.  There is some code about verifying the origin of the
webhook, but it is only in Ruby.  I need to find the Perl equivalent.

Also came upon a great article by Ron Jeffries on
[getting rid of the Backlog](http://ronjeffries.com/articles/015-10/the-backlog/article.html),
with a capital B.  He proposes a drastic move away from long-term planning and
keeping everyone focused on in-the-moment discussions.  Some ideas that stood
out: deploy before the product review meeting to show live features, the product
review is where it's at, the product owner keeps a personal backlog on index
cards away from prying eyes.  It would be a tough sell to make upper management
give up their false sense of predictability.  I'm not ready to push things as
far as Ron does, but it's always a good idea to challenge your assumptions.

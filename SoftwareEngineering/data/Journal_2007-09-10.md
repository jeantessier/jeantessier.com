Got a technician to come and install my new motherboard.  When we booted up the
machine, it flashed a blue screen and tried to reboot again.  The technician
thinks the crash corrupted the OS files and I will have to reinstall Windows.
When I did, all the driver configuration was wrong.  I can't get to 1600x1200
with 32-bit graphics, I can't get sound, and I can't get on the network.  I
have a CD with drivers, but it has drivers for all Alienware hardware and I
can't figure out which ones are the ones I need.

More work on using [[https://github.com/daveliepmann/tufte-css][Tufte CSS]].  I
might be able to get away with minimal changes to the Perl script that processes
my wiki notation.

I tried to apply it to my blog too.  Quoted paragraphs run the full width of the
page instead of staying within the main text column because I don't wrap their
contents in =&lt;p&gt;= tags.  And the =&lt;pre&gt;= tags are hard to read when
I have to scroll horizontally; code snippets run out of horizontal room very
quickly.

There are times when I use numbered lists when the order matters, and these also
run the full width of the page, which looks strange.  I also use bullet lists
when the ordering does not matter; but the Tufte style removes the bullets,
turning the list into indented (short) paragraphs that are somewhat less
powerful.

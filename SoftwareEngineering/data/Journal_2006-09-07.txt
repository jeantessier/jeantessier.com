I used to keep my blog in a static HTML file and write it all by hand, markup
and all.  That was tedious.

Today, I wrote a CGI script in Perl to break it up into individual text files,
one per day, and use my pseudo-wiki processor from Dependency Finder to
generate the page dynamicaly.  This way, when I want to add an entry, I simply
add a text file with a much easier notation than fullblown HTML.

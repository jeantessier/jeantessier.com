So far, I've been managing the files for my website by hand, with only Emacs to
edit the files.  Aside from CSS, each file contains everything it needs.  One
upside is that I can open them locally with a browser.  The downside is that
there is a fair bit of code duplication between the files.

I started to partition things a bit more.  I host my site on Dreamhost, which
runs Apache and supports server-side includes.  I extracted some of the common
navigation into partials.  I also extracted the Google Analytics tracking code
to its own `.js` file.  I know this defeats the purpose of Google's Asynchronous
Snippet, which is to not delay the loading of the page by including other
scripts synchronously.  But if it's the only one being loaded, the delays are
barely noticeable.  I timed it using Chrome's developer tools and the time to
load a typical page went from just under 100ms to about 170ms.  A large increase
but still _fast enough_.

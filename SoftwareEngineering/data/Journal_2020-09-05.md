Looking at what it would take to migrate to Markdown, again.

I looked at [Showdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown) (290k weekly
downloads).  I have a proof-of-concept with an
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) app.  The documentation talks about using
it with [Angular](https://angular.io/), but my Book Reviews app is in
[React](https://reactjs.org/).  I guess it's simple enough to use that I could
work it into my React app.

Or, I could use
[`react-markdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) instead (523k
weekly downloads).  It is made for React and it is even simpler to use.

I might have to make do with using Showdown on the blog, which is still in
AngularJS, and `react-markdown` with the reading lists.  There is a small risk
that their Markdown implementations will diverge on the fringes, but I doubt it
will impact me.  What I need is pretty minimal.

I only converted the files for `/Books.html` and `/BooksBackLog.html` first,
followed by  `/SoftwareEngineering/Books.html` and
`/SoftwareEngineering/BooksBackLog.html`.  I used a somewhat simple Perl script
to convert these files.

I can only convert the data for `/SoftwareEngineering/Journal.html`
after I've upgraded its Angular app to use Markdown too.

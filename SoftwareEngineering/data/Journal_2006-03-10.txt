I finished reading an updated version of [[MartinFowler.html][Martin Fowler]]'s
[[http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html][The New Methodology]],
his article on agile processes.  In it, he talks about how they distinguish
themselves by focusing on the iterative nature of development and being
people-centric.

I have been thinking about this lately.  To me, agile processes are first
and foremost about feedback.  They try to make you close the feedback loop and
keep it real short, so you can get a lot of good information in a timely manner
and better steer the project especially in the face of changing
requirements.

A friend of mine keeps mixing methodologies and individual practices.  He
talks of the Test-Driven Development methodology or the Pair Programming
methodology.  I don't know that it's really worth my time to try to set him
straight, that these are just practices in a larger context, not ends in and of
themselves.  For what he needs, his concerns are of a higher nature: get the
software done and answer customer needs.  His interests do not lie in knowing
the finer details of this methodology versus that methodology.  And it's OK.
He focuses on figuring out what needs to be done and he can let the developers
worry about the details of which methodology and which practices to put in
place to do it.

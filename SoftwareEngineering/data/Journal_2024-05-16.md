I made it to this month's
[SF Ruby Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/san-francisco-ruby-meetup-group/)!  And
I made friends with Mert Atkin, who remembered me from my days at Gusto.

There was one presentation which they drove using TDD and RSpec.  Another
presentation showed a toolkit that targets applications running on mobile,
complete with live reload.  Apparently, Turbo Native does something very
similar.  Overall, it was a very nice meetup.

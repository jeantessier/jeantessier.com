Looked into [WebWork](http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/), a
web application framework based on MVC-2.  I've always been unclear about the
distinction between MVC-1 and MVC-2, but reading through it finally drove the
point home.  In MVC-1, the navigation between controllers and views is embedded
in the JSPs (views) themselves.  In MVC-2, the navigation is encapsulated in a
central dispatcher and usually driven declaratively by a configuration file.
WebWork also uses an Inversion of Control framework to inject dependencies into
components that make up the MVC-2 structure.

I have been considering for some time to redo the Dependency Finder web app
with some kind of MVC structure.  Right now, all the logic is embedded into the
JSPs themselves as large scriplets.  While this is not maintainable on  large
scale project, in the case of Dependency Finder it kept things simple and kept
the size of the WAR file down.  At one point, I thought of using Struts, but
the libraries it requires were too big and I didn't want to ship them with
Dependency Finder.  I'll have to see if it's the same for WebWork.

It feels nice to learn something new and on the cutting edge.  It had been
a while.

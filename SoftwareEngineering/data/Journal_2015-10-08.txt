Learned about [[https://ottoproject.io/][Otto]], a new tool to manage
development versus deployment environments.  It uses virtualization technologies
like [[https://www.vagrantup.com/][Vagrant]] and infrastructure management
technologies like [[https://terraform.io/][Terraform]].  Run one command to spin
up a development environment based on current best practices (opinionated?).
Run another command to deploy to your (opinionated?) production environment.  I
like the idea of automating all this configuration management.  It doesn't
auto-detect Grails applications yet, though.  :-(

On a separate note, the [[http://www.usgs.gov/][USGS]] wants to use Twitter to
detect earthquakes, kinda like =[[https://xkcd.com/723/][xkcd]]= had predicted.

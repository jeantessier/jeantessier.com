I asked [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) what to use to replace the
[Bitnami Kafka](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/kafka) image I was using.  It
suggested either [Apache Kafka](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/kafka) or
[Redpanda](https://hub.docker.com/r/redpandadata/redpanda).

The configuration for Apache Kafka is eerily similar to Bitnami Kafka.  Getting
the settings right between `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `kafka` is delicate.
When I was finally able to connect a Ruby client, using the `phobos` gem, the
broker complained about an unsupported protocol version.  This gem has not been
updated since 2023.  Newer libraries like Karafka want to run consumers in
separate processes.  When I connected a Node client, I got an error about
string content in the Kafka messages.

Looks like I have more work ahead of me.

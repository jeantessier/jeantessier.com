We're using [[http://grails.org/][Grails]] at work.  I went through the first
chapter and the starting tutorial.  I was using Grails 1.1.1, but ran into some
snags.  The =save()= method of domain objects didn't work.  I downgraded to
version 1.1 and it worked fine.  I upgraded to version 1.2-M3 (experimental)
and it worked, but something failed later on when I introduced a service, as per
the example.  The section on testing talked about integration tests, but the
code samples were for unit tests.  The book could have used more proof reading.

Buying the physical book entitled me to download the PDF version for free.
That's nice.

It mentioned Guice in passing when talking about dependency injection.  I hoped
there would be a way to use Guice with Grails.  That would have been awesome.
But a look at the index and a search through the PDF showed one a single
reference to the word "Guice".  Too bad.  It seems Grails uses Spring internally
for its dependency injection needs.  It does have an interesting automatic
injection mechanism for certain classes.  Controllers, for instance, only need
to create a variable with a given service's name and it gets injected
automagically.  It doesn't seem to work for tests, though; I can't ask for a
service instance to be injected in my test for the service.

_More to come._

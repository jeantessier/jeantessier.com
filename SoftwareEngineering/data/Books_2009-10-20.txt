We're using [[http://grails.org/][Grails]] at work.  I went through the first
chapter and the starting tutorial.  I was using Grails 1.1.1, but ran into some
snags.  The =save()= method of domain objects didn't work.  I downgraded to
version 1.1 and it worked fine.  I upgraded to version 1.2-M3 (experimental)
and it worked, but something failed later on when I introduced a service, as per
the example.  The section on testing talked about integration tests, but the
code samples were for unit tests.  The book could have used more proof reading.

It mentioned Guice in passing when talking about dependency injection.  I hope
there is a way to plug in Guice into Grails.  That'd be awesome.

The book entitled me to download the PDF version for free.  That's nice.

_More to come._

I was finally able to attend a BayXP meeting again.  I missed quite a few in
a row due to working late those particular evenings at the office or other
distractions.  I was able to make it to the
[ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/us/) offices in San
Francisco at watch a presentation on [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/).
Exposed brick walls, exposed old wood rafters, the place had character
despite the earthquake retrofitting.

The talk was pretty lively and was a nice introduction to working with
Fitnesse and its place in the development process than a nuts and bolts view
into writing fixtures.  Details of the talk are
[here](http://agileworks.blogspot.com/2005/05/joy-and-pain-with-fitnesse.html).

I met with two former colleagues from my days at Epicentric and Vignette
who were at the meeting.  We all work for separate startups now.

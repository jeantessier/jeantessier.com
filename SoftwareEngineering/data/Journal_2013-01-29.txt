I was listening to French programming podcast
[[http://lescastcodeurs.com/][Les Cast Codeurs]] 
[[http://lescastcodeurs.com/2012/11/29/les-cast-codeurs-podcast-episode-68-devoxx-2012-et-les-putchettes/][episode 68]]
about [[http://devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home][Devoxx 2012]].  They asked
attendees about their favorite session and a majority of them mentioned the
session on [[http://angularjs.org/][AngularJS]].  It was led by my good buddy
[[http://misko.hevery.com/][Mi&#353;ko Hevery]] and his AngularJS co-conspirator
Igor Minar.  I am very happy for their success with AngularJS.  I'm more geared
towards jQuery at the moment, but AngularJS looks like a very nice JavaScript
framework too.

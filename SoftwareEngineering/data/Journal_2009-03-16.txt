We had a visit from
[[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html][Donald Knuth]] at
work.  The title of the talk was "Faith and Science" and meant to give his
perspective on the interplay of religion and science.  I missed the beginning,
but I have to admit the open questions portion I attended was pretty horrible.
Attendees would ask some fundamental questions of reconciling elements of faith
and science; Knuth would dance around the question nervously for multiple
minutes before finally admitting that _he didn't know_.  Now, don't get me
wrong.  I have great respect for a man who knows his limitations and admits he
doesn't know something.  But not after leading us on for five minutes.

He quickly introduced his
[[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/316.html][Project 3:16]], where he
is studying a vertical slice of the Bible.  Here, he is taking chapter 3, verse
16 of each book of the Bible and researching what commentators and theologians
have written about it.  He picked 3:16 because of
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_3_16][John 3:16]].  So far, he's only done
that one slice.  It would be very interesting to see what shows up for other
slices.

Aside from that, he had nothing original to say.  When you're someone of this
caliber and you have nothing to say, don't make a one hour lecture out of it.

The talk might make its way onto [[http://youtube.com/][YouTube]] eventually.

Finished migrating all my content to Markdown.  The Book Reviews React app now
uses [`react-markdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) to render
the book reviews.  The Journal AngularJS app uses
[Showdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown) to render the blog.

All that is left are the RSS Atom feeds.  For these, I am going to need a Perl
implementation of Markdown.  Or else, find a way to serve Markdown content in an
Atom feed.

Finished migrating all my content to Markdown.  The Book Reviews React app now
uses [`react-markdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) to render
the book reviews.  The Journal AngularJS app uses
[Showdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown) to render the blog.

All that was left were the Atom feeds.  They publish content in XHTML, so I
would have to either find a way to convert Markdown to XHTML, or else, find a
way to embed the Markdown in the Atom feeds.  The
[Atom specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.1.3) mentions
various types of contents, and it includes all the `text/*` MIME types.  If
aggregators can understand `text/markdown`, I can use that to embed the Markdown
directly into the feed.  It may not be as _structured_ as using XHTML, but it
might be a lot easier.

I no longer need the bespoke wiki files.

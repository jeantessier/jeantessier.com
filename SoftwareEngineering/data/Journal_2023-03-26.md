[Lex Fridman interview Sam Altman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Guz73e6fw),
the CEO of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).  They talked about the future of AI.

I thought they over-estimate today's AI capabilities.  GPT-4 is good at
generating text that sounds coherent.  It understands grammar very well, and it
can sting words together that appear genuine.  But it does not have any sense
whatsoever of the semantics of what it is saying.  It sounds authoritative, but
it has no way to determine if it is correct or not.  I can see a danger if
people accept its output uncritically.

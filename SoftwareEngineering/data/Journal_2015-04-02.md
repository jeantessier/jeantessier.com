I came upon [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown), a way to render
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as JavaScript embedded
in an HTML page.  I wrote [a tiny test page](AngularShowdownTest/index.html)
using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to try writing markdown text in a
`<textarea>`, convert it to HTML using Showdown, and use the generated HTML to
populate a `<div>`.

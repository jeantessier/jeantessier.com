Launched [Directly.com](http://directly.com) and got a mention in
[AllThingsD](http://allthingsd.com/20121203/directly-is-a-taskrabbit-for-online-customer-service/).
All this after a crazy weekend tying up loose ends and making sure the site was
tight.  At this time last year, we had officially launched Insidr.com and gone
through the pains of changing the DNS from Insidr.net to Insidr.com.  The
infrastructure we deployed at the time, three frontends and a DB backend, should
be good enough for some time, still.

Decided to go PC-less.  I picked up my broken Alienware PC from the repair shop.
I didn't call ahead and the PC was still in pieces: heatsink, CPU, DIMMs.  No
matter.  I got a
[KWI-S2](http://www.kingwin.com/products/cate/accessories/adapters/manual/kwi_s2_manual.pdf)
SATA-to-USB converter, so I can connect my two hard drives to my Mac to get the
files back.  Best $17 ever.

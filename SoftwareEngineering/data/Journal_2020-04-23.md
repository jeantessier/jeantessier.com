I found a way to do data-driven tests in [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).  I was
doing a code review for a colleague when I noticed a series of separate tests
for various inputs: a string, an integer, a float, a negative value, etc.  My
colleague could rewrite their tests much more succinctly with a table showing
various inputs and their expected results.

```ruby
RSpec.describe SomeClassUnderTest do
    describe '#some_method_under_test' do
        subject { described_class.new.some_method_under_test input_value }
        
        [
            [ 'a string', '123', '123.00' ],
            [ 'an integer', 123, '123.00' ],
            [ 'a float', 123.0, '123.00' ],
            [ 'a negative number', -123, '-123.00' ],
            [ 'nil', nil, 'nil' ],
        ].each do |variation, input, expected_output|
            describe 'when the input is #{variation}' do
                let(:input_value) { input }
                it { is_expected.to eq(expected_output) }
            end
        end
        
        describe 'when the input is invalid' do
            let(:input_value) { 'invalid' }
            it { expect { subject }.to raise_error }
        end
    end
end
```

I have to remind myself that the Ruby interpreter is running while Ruby is
parsing its own program.  This gives a lot of opportunities for the program to
generate itself.  Sounds dangerous, but it is also _very_ powerful.

I drew inspiration from
[an old Stack Overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8754582/best-way-to-organize-tests-in-rspec-that-have-a-combinations-of-factor).
It also has another example that uses `shared_examples`.

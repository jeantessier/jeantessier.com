Discovered [Conduktor](https://www.conduktor.io/), a management UI for Kafka.  I
like that they have a free tier for developers, but I wish I didn't have to
register an account with them to do so.  It's nice of them to they let you use
all paid features for the first fourteen days.  It connects to a locally running
Kafka setup just fine, but I wish it could find a way to connect to one running
in Docker Compose without having to expose ports.

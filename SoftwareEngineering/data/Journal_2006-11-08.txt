Latest chapter in my quest for a job title: _Software Designer_.  I was
looking at a job description from Qu&eacute;bec, where you cannot call yourself
an engineer unless you are a member of their professional organization.  Since
I got my degree in Computer Science and not in Engineering, I could not call
myself a software engineer, but a software designer would work just fine.

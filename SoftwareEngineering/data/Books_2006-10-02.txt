The book was pretty good, very practical, steeped in the
author's extensive experience.  The presentation style was very
approachable and lively.

Someone once said that Scrum was just the planning game from
eXtreme Programming.  It definitely is fairly simple to implement.
It focuses on the communication between the development team and
the project stakeholders and leaves the developers free to work
however they see fit.

I was reading the second edition of
_[[Books.html#Grails%5Fin%5FAction%5FSecond%5FEdition][Grails in Action]]_ and
it has a whole chapter dealing with NoSQL.  It showcases some of the more common
NoSQL databases and possible usage patterns.

    * [[http://redis.io/][Redis]] for key/value pairs, good for caching and stats.
    * [[http://www.mongodb.org/][MongoDB]] for documents, good for JSON and map/reduce.
    * [[http://neo4j.com/][Neo4J]] for graphs, might be useful for Dependency Finder.

These have good integration plugins for Grails.

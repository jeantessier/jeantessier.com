I upgraded Docker Desktop from `3.3.3` to `3.4.0` and it wiped out all my Docker
images and their data, including my local MySQL and MongoDB images.  I didn't
lose anything that I cannot recreate, but it is still annoying.  For a few
things that interest me, like Redis and RabbitMQ and Kafka, I have dedicated
`docker-compose.yml` files.  But for these databases, I had created the image
manually some time ago.  I thought I had set them up to use mounted volumes for
storage, but I can't seem to find where these folders would have been; they are
not in the usual places.  Maybe I will have learned my lesson and I will set
them up under Docker Compose, this time.

Ever since I started reading about Angular and Node, I've been wondering how to
do TDD in those environments.  The books keep mentioning how things are done
this or that way to support testing, but all the testing they do is manual.
Never mind TDD, how can I automate any of the tests at the very least?

Today, I stumbled upon
[[https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action][Express in Action]], which
has an entire chapter on automated testing.  There is a framework called Mocha
that seems the equivalent of Spock or RSpec.  There is an assertion library
called Chai that looks similar to Hamcrest.  And there is SuperTest and Cheerio
for integration testing akin to HttpUnit and HtmlUnit respectively.

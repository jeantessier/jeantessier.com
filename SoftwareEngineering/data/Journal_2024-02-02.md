Back on 2019-11-28, I created my Book Reviews app, a React app, using
[`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/).  It set up a project with
Yarn and I've been happy with it ever since.  The transition from Yarn 1 to Yarn
2 has been rough, because the commands to manage dependency versions changed.
They used to be straightforward but the new `yarn up` tries to abstract away a
lot of things and I feel I'm losing control.

Today, I went to update some dependencies with `yarn up -R '*'`.  After the
update, Jest wouldn't work anymore.  The dependency update pulled in some new
transitive dependencies and I had to update `transformIgnorePatterns` so Jest
would treat them correctly.  In the past, that was enough to get Jest back on
track.  But not this time.  Now, I get this error message:

```
Cannot find module 'unist-util-visit-parents/do-not-use-color' from 'node_modules/unist-util-visit-parents/lib/index.js'
```

Searching the Internet yields this pearl:
["your tooling is quite out of date."](https://github.com/orgs/remarkjs/discussions/1247)

It looks like `create-react-app` is no longer cool and it has been supplanted by
things like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and
[Remix](https://remix.run/).  I've also heard of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
and [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) (by [Mi&#353;ko Hevery](http://misko.hevery.com/)
of Angular fame).  Looks like I have some catching up to do.

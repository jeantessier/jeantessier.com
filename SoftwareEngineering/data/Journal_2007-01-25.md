I just realized that I've been working with Alex Martelli, author of some of the
most popular books on Python, for the past six months and I didn't even
realize it.  He wrote or co-wrote:

- [Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition](http://amzn.com/0596100469)
- [Python Cookbook](http://amzn.com/0596007973)

What a small world.

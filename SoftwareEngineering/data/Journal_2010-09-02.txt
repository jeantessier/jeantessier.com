I played a bit with downloadable fonts using the =@font-face= support in CSS.
I got some free fonts from
[[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/][exljbris Font Foundry]] and tried them on
my reading list.  The free fonts don't come with italics and bold versions.  I
use italics for quotations and I sometimes use bold for emphasis.  All that goes
away if I limit myself to these free fonts.  (And no, I'm not going to start
paying for fonts for personal use on my personal website.)  Fertigo Pro looks
nice, if it weren't for the lack of styling.

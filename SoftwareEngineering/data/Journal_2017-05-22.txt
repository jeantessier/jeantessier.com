At the [[http://apimixtape.com/][API Mixtape conference]], everybody was talking
about [[http://graphql.org/][GraphQL]] as the latest favorite way to build
service APIs.  Today, [[https://github.com/][GitHub]] announced that
[[https://developer.github.com/v4/][their service API now uses GraphQL]].  They
even include an Explorer that lets you issue queries and inspect results.  Or,
you can use =curl= or Postman with an OAuth token.

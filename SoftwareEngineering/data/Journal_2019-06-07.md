I was watching a video on [SQL vs. NoSQL](https://youtu.be/ZS_kXvOeQ5Y) and
the presenter kept talking about standalone collections in MongoDB.  In his
example, there is a `Users` collection where each document describes a user
fully.  There is also an `Orders` collection where each order has a user.  I'm
used to simply having the user's ID in that `user` field and let the calling
code merge the order and user documents.  Like you'd do in a relational database
with a `JOIN` statement.  But in their example, `user` field was an actual
subset of the matching user document, with just the parts that are needed when
dealing with an order.

For example, if the user is:

    {
        "id": 1234,
        "name": "Jean Tessier",
        "username": "jeantessier",
        "password": "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }

The order might not need things like `username` and `password`, so it would
look like:

    {
        "id": 5678,
        "user": {
            "id": 1234,
            "name": "Jean Tessier"
        },
        // other stuff related to the order
    }

This way, when I load an order, I don't need to merge it with anything else.
This is great for read-intensive applications.

Of course, if the user changes their name, now you have to find all of that
user's orders and update them.  This is not so great for write-intensive
applications.

I'm used to thinking in terms of normalized data.  But this is an interesting
application of denormalized data for read-intensive applications.

The most recent book from Kent Beck.  Cleaning up the code to keep quality high
and making it easy to add feature.  "Make the change easy, then make the easy
change."

This is the sense in which I call myself a software craftsman, and not
necessarily the one defined by the Software Craftsmanship&trade; movement.

Once, as a teaching assistant, I deducted 1 point out of 100 from a student
because their code said:

    c = a + b  // Add up a and b

To this they, this student is still mad at me for getting 99% on that
assignment.  I might have excused it if it had been part of a complicated
calculation, like "do all this to compute 'a'" and "do all that to compute 'b'"
and "now add them up."  But it wasn't the case for this student in that
assignment.

_More to come._

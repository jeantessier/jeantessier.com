Continuing my exploration of the MEAN stack, I managed to write a
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) app using the
[Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework to pull data from
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/).  I followed the examples in
[_Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node_](Books.html#Getting_MEAN)
and even setup the resulting app on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and
[MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/).

You can see the results
[here](https://afternoon-cliffs-9951.herokuapp.com/Books.html).

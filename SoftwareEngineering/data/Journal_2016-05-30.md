Looked at using
[GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) to
document my [Book Reviews](https://github.com/jeantessier/book-reviews) pet
project.

In the process, I started looking into [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), as it
is the preferred engine for GitHub Pages.  I like how it has built-in support
for blogs using a filename format that's very close to my own home-grown blog.
Maybe I should consider switching parts (or all) of my website to my GitHub User
Pages.

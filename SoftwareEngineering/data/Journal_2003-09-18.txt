When I write software, I care about doing a good job and writing well
structured code that will be easy to maintain.  Maybe I am not a computer
scientist but more of a _software craftsman_.  What kind of title would
that make?  I think it conveys a feeling of coming up with individual
solutions adapted to the problem at hand, not applying rote techniques from a
code book.  It rings of taking pride in one's work, of being highly skilled at
solving solving problems.  That sounds good to me.

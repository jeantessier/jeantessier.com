Learned about [Otto](https://ottoproject.io/), a new tool to manage
development versus deployment environments.  It uses virtualization technologies
like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and infrastructure management
technologies like [Terraform](https://terraform.io/).  Run one command to spin
up a development environment based on current best practices (opinionated?).
Run another command to deploy to your (opinionated?) production environment.  I
like the idea of automating all this configuration management.  It doesn't
auto-detect Grails applications yet, though.  :-(

On a separate note, the [USGS](http://www.usgs.gov/) wants to use Twitter to
detect earthquakes, kinda like [`xkcd`](https://xkcd.com/723/) had predicted.
Here is a
[news report on USGS](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/twitter-being-used-usgs-detect-earthquakes-n440976).

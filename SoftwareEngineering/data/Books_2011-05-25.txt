At work, we use jQuery for client-side logic.  Since we don't have a front-end
engineer yet, I need to be able to maintain and extend this code.  I like the
other "... in Action" books and this one has good ratings on Amazon.  Plus, I
get the PDF of it so I can search through it for specific keywords.

Right off the bat, the introduction to jQuery really helped me make sense of the
notation and some of the weird incantations.  It also mentioned some DOM
navigation methods that I will be able to apply immediately to our codebase to
make it a little better.

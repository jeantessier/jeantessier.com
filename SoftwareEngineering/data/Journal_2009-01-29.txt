It turns out the Guice people were already working on
[[http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/issues/detail?id=231][something along the lines of the pattern]]
I documented yesterday.  With my solution, you can repeat it over and over,
with different qualifiers, into an arbitrarily long chain.  The =@New=
annotation that Guice is considering is a one-shot deal.

I added my tests to the write up.  I wrote the code tests first, so I figured
the write up should reflect that.

Came upon another great episode of the
[[http://www.greaterthancode.com/2018/10/31/103-the-org-you-were-born-into-with-marcus-blankenship/][Greater Than Code]]
podcast that talked about "the org you were born into" and how the corporate
culture at your first job shapes your expectations for the remainder of your
career.  Its progression doesn't have to be one dimension and force you into
management.  And it doesn't help that many of us have very misguided ideas of
what management really is.  The company can provide progressions paths that
cater to each employee's goals.  This is similar to what Kim Scott is saying in

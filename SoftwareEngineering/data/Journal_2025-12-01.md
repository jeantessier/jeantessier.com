This year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) is only 12 days
long.  I want to do them in Ruby again, even though I've worked mostly in
JavaScript and TypeScript this year.  Ruby has more capabilities out-of-the-box
to do small data manipulations like the ones in Advent of Code.  I'm still
[putting it on GitHub](https://github.com/jeantessier/advent-of-code-2025).

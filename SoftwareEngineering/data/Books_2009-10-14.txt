I hesitated between getting this book or
[[http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Version-Control-Using-Starter/dp/1934356158/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b][Pragmatic Version Control Using Git]],
but a colleague recommended against the latter.

I'm not going to read it cover to cover, but it's already been very helpful
with sharing branches via an authoritative repository and interacting with
Subversion.  So far, the explanations are clear and the examples are brief and
to the point.

_More to come._

Trying to understand [Hibernate JPA](https://hibernate.org/orm/).  There sure
is a lot of boilerplate code.  I found
[examples in Java](https://www.javahelps.com/2015/08/jpa-hello-world-using-hibernate.html),
but they require a lot of code to use the entities defined with Hibernate.

I'm trying to get a sample application working with
[`micronaut-data`](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-data).  It
can either use a JPA configuration or straight SQL, without Hibernate.  I'm
trying to figure out which would be easiest to use, but I can't quite get them
to work right.  I picked up some JPA configuration from the `hibernate-jpa`
feature in Micronaut, but I'm still getting some errors:

> _Interface method reference: `CrudRepository.findAll()`, is in an indirect
> superinterface_

that I can't quite shake off.

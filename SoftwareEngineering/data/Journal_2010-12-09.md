Moved some of my local tinkering projects to [GitHub](http://github.com/).

- [`jeantessier/Mocking`](http://github.com/jeantessier/Mocking)
- [`jeantessier/TwoStageGuiceProvider`](http://github.com/jeantessier/TwoStageGuiceProvider)

And only **after** I had uploaded them did I realize that the `build.xml` file in
each project contained my account password.  Drats!  I had to go and change it
super quickly.

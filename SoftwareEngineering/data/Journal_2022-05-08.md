[This article](https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/)
nicely retraces the history of _software engineering_ and agile methodologies.
It speaks to the core of conflict between developers and management.  Developers
want the dignity and autonomy of human beings.  Management is beholden to the
bottom line and wants control and predictability over the means of production.
I have seen the means of Agile, like stand-ups and story points, be weaponized
and used against the developers.  Often, it is done by middle managers who mean
well but are caught between the reality of software development and the
aspirations of management.  (And other times, it is done by sociopaths.)

First day at [Arbo](https://arbo.works/).

Arbo was started by former Googlers and they use many Google technologies that
I will have to re-familiarize myself with: [Bazel](https://bazel.build/),
[protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers),
[Python](https://www.python.org/), and the
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) in all its glory.

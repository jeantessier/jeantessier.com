Good, practical guide for understanding how regular expressions
work without going into the deep stuff about automata theory.  I
was hoping for more practical coverage of different syntaxes and
more examples rewritten in each, especially Emacs.  Still, quite
good about regular expressions in general.  But if you want to
learn a particular flavor, you will need something more focused on
that language or tool.

There is a more recent edition published in 2002 with 150
additional pages that I haven't looked at.

I volunteered to read
[Agile Software Development, 2nd Edition](http://amzn.com/0321482751).
I have only one week to read it and do a report.  I had to stop by a booktore
on my way home to buy a copy.  I had read the first edition and done a
presentation back when I was at Vignette, I should be able to reuse a lot of
that material.

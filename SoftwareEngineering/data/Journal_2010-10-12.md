Found some more free fonts,
[Fontin](http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html) and
[Fontin Sans](http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontinsans.html), that include
bold and italics.  Fontin Sans even has bold-italics.  Both also include small
caps variations, but for some reason I couldn't get that part to work.  But I
used the others successfully on my book blogs and on my home page.

Forword to Domain-Driven Design.  I really like how
[Martin Fowler](MartinFowler.html) says that domain modelers should
be able to talk to customers in the domain language and talk with developers in
the implementation language, e.g., Java.  Do you think he means by
_domain modeler_ what our current analysts should be doing?  I, for one think so,
which makes the current situation that much more depressing.

Took another swing at making [Micronaut](http://micronaut.io) and
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) work together.  Now, there is an
experimental integration named `micronaut-rabbitmq` to help out.  The project
creator doesn't put a version number on the `micronaut-rabbitmq` and because
only a milestone version is currently on Maven, you have to put its version
number explicitly in your `build.gradle` file.

It is not quite as absolutely awesome as the `rabbitmq-native` plugin for
[Grails](http://grails.org/); it's missing the super easy declarative topic
and queue management, it relies heavily on annotations.

My trivial integration is on GitHub at
[`jeantessier/micronaut-rabbitmq-test`](https://github.com/jeantessier/micronaut-rabbitmq-test).

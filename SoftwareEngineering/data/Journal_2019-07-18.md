The folks who gave us [Grails](http://grails.org/) and
[Micronaut](http://micronaut.io) are at it again.  This time, it is a project
called [Predator](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-predator),
for _pre-compiled data layer_.  If provides a lot of the magic that you can get
from [GORM](http://gorm.grails.org/), but whereas GORM operates at runtime,
Predator does its magic at compile-time.  It is particularly well suited for
Micronaut, to keep the executable small and the application start time fast.

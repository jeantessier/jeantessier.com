Finally managed to replace some of my CGI scripts with
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) applications.  The apps get their contents
from CGI scripts that read from the `data` directory and produce JSON.  I
started working on them after reading
[_AngularJS in Action_](Books.html#AngularJS_in_Action), but got stuck
after my code landed in an infinite loop.  I caught a break by looking at the
AngularJS chapters of
[_Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node_](Books.html#Getting_MEAN).

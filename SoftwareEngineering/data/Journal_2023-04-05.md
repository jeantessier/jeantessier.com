Today, I learned of the
[death of Bob "CrazyBob" Lee](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/05/technology/cash-app-founder-stabbed-san-francisco.html).
I had met him back when I was working at Google, and I was impressed by his
talent as a software engineer.  He was a co-author of
[Guice](https://github.com/google/guice), the best dependency injection I have
ever seen.  This is very sad and he will be missed.

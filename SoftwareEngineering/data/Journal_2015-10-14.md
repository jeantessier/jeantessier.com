Tried to write my first AngularJS app.  It's a variation on this Journal.  I
already wrote a version of the CGI script that returns the blog contents as a
JSON object.  Next, I want to write an AngularJS app that consumes this JSON and
renders it on the screen.

I'm struggling to find clear, concise explanations for doing simple things.  The
examples and tutorials always muddy the waters with trying to do something
useful as the same time as they are illustrating how to do a service or use
`$http`.

I managed to get an initial version to run, with a hard-coded JSON in my
controller.  Then, I tried to use a service to fetch the JSON dynamically.  At
first from a file, but ran into browser limitations regarding which protocols
are allowed to access resources in other domains.  I couldn't run it locally and
distributed debugging doesn't appeal to me.

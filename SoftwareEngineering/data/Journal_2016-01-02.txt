Continuing my exploration of the MEAN stack, I managed to write a
[[https://nodejs.org/en/][node.js]] app using the
[[http://expressjs.com/][Express]] framework to pull data from
[[https://www.mongodb.org/][MongoDB]].  I followed the examples in
[[Books.html#Getting%5FMEAN][Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node]]
and even setup the resulting app on [[https://www.heroku.com/][Heroku]] and
[[https://mongolab.com/][MongoLab]].

You can see the results

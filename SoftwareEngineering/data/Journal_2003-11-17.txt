I read two useful articles.

The first one was by Eric S. Raymond of open source fame.  He talked about
how the open-source movement and agile programming have a lot in common.  One
thing is for sure, Mr. Raymond does not suffer from too much humility.  But he
goes about showing how the open source practitioners have been following agile
practices for years but didn't have words to describe what they were doing.  So
both sides benefit from each other.  Open source validates agile practices in
real world development and agile methodologies provide a formal framework to
discuss _hacking_, as Raymond calls it.  You can read article at:

The second article was much more enlightening.  It was about ethics and
professionalism for software people.  A lot of people think of professional
behavior as dressing sharp and not offending anyone.  But author, Philip
Greenspun, argues that real professionalism should promote and advance the
procession.  Professional programmers should dedicate themselves to high
quality work, innovation, and sharing what they learn with others.  You can

Reformatting my resume.  I have been trying to replace HTML tables with proper
`div` and `span` elements, but I can't get them to flow quite right.  Friends
suggested I look into
[Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp).  I found
[a handy tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
and I was able to clean up the hand-crafted HTML for my resume.  No more
`float: right` mysteries.

There is also some nice documentation for the
[Grid Layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and it has its own
[handy tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
too.
